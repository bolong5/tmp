502632d7,http://www.menshealth.co.uk/sex/please-woman/10-bizarre-sex-studies,10 bizarre sex studies,"Every year brings another spate of bonkers sex research. This year was no different. Researchers have spent the last 12 months working out the answers to some really bizarre sex questions. While the usefulness of the info is dubious, the entertainment value is undeniable. We compiled 10 kinky (and kooky) sex studies for your pleasure.
1. Bigger isn’t better
A study in PLOS One found the longer your penis, the greater the likelihood your wife will cheat on you. Accommodating a big penis is uncomfortable and sometimes painful, the women in the study said. So the bigger a man was below the belt, the more likely a woman was to go searching for a smaller, more comfortable model.
2. Hands at 10 and 2, pal
After investigating the common sexual activities people engage in while driving, a University of South Dakota team declared behind-the-wheel hanky panky to be “an under-reported in-vehicle distraction” that required more prevention efforts. As you might guess, a guy getting a road job from a female passenger topped the list of risky manoeuvres. More surprising: 11 percent of the men polled admitted they had rubbed one out while driving. Which explains those guys cruising 5mph under the limit in the slow lane.
3. She’ll go through the change
It’s common for women who have stopped taking birth control to feel little or no attraction to their long-time sexual partner, according to a study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The pill messes with a woman’s hormone levels, which can alter the traits and characteristics she finds attractive in a man, the study authors say.
4. The look that lures
Every few months a new facial hair survey or study pops up claiming to know the look women love – be it a beard, 5 o’clock shadow, or a clean shave. But a clever Australian study may have finally revealed the truth that underlies what women dig in a dude’s facial hair: individuality. Translation: If you work in an office where everyone’s clean-shaven, a beard may be your best way to lure a sexy co-worker. But if your favourite hipster bar is filled with bearded bros (and they all are), a clean shave may set you apart.
5. Smells like B.S.
Thanks to some weird interaction between your genes and your natural body odours and pheromones, you’re more likely to be attracted to (and land) a partner who shares your political ideology. According to a Brown University study, staunch conservatives and liberals were attracted to the natural scents of people who shared their political leanings – and were repelled by the aromas of their party rivals.
6. Falling head over her heels
Remember this news about her shoes? In a study from a few months ago, French researchers had women ask different guys for directions. The women wore either flats or high heels, but nothing else about their appearance or their request changed. When the women sported stilettos, the guys helped them out 83 percent of the time. But the men’s helpfulness dropped to 47 percent when the women wore flats.
7. Mind your backside
What sex position is easiest on your back? Researchers at the University of Waterloo in Canada wanted to find out, so they asked men and women to do it in a lab so they could take measurements of their “spine kinematic profiles” for signs of stress. If leaning forward hurts, doggystyle should be your go-to position, the study authors conclude. And stay away from side positions, which will put the most strain on your spine. But if arching backward causes pain, do it on your side, the authors advise.
8. Nature’s Prozac
Casual sex gets a bad rap. (STDs! Awkward goodbyes!) But for people who feel drawn to one-night stands and flings, a little no-strings-attached lovin’ lowers anxiety and depression, boosts self-confidence, and is generally pretty great for you in terms of life satisfaction, found a study from Cornell University and NYU.
9. Take off that apron
The more a couple shares household responsibilities and chores, the less sex they have, found a study in The American Sociological Review. The study authors found men who completed traditionally “feminine chores”—things like cleaning, folding laundry, and vacuuming—had sex with their wives 1.5 fewer times a month than guys who said “F that” when asked to chip in with the house work.
10. The problem with soul mates
The more you think of your partner as your “soul mate,” the less happy you’ll end up in your relationship, suggested a study from the University of Toronto. All couples go through hard times. But if you regard your partner as a “soul mate,” you’re more likely to feel unsettled or freaked out by relationship rough patches, the authors speculated. On the other hand, taking your girl off that pedestal can make it easier for you both to absorb and move past conflicts, the study suggested.

cb4ef493,http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/giants-release-josh-brown-domestic-violence-saga-article-1.2844561,Giants release Josh Brown following months-long domestic violence saga,"Josh Brown is finally released by the Giants.
More than three months after Josh Brown's domestic violence history became public, the Giants cut ties with their embattled kicker.
Big Blue announced it had waived Brown on Tuesday, shortly after the kicker released an initial statement claiming he never ""struck"" his wife — and after players had already finished speaking with the media and left the facility for the team’s bye week.
“We believed we did the right thing at every juncture in our relationship with Josh,” Giants owner John Mara said in a statement. “Our beliefs, our judgments and our decisions were misguided. We accept that responsibility. We hope that Josh will continue to dedicate himself to rehabilitation, and to becoming a better person and father. We will continue to support him in his efforts to continue counseling, and we hope that Josh and his family can find peace and a positive resolution.
""We have great respect and feel strongly about our support for the good people who work tirelessly and unconditionally to aid the victims of domestic violence and who bring awareness to the issue. We have been partners with My Sisters’ Place (a domestic violence shelter and advocate based in Westchester, New York) for nearly 20 years. The leadership of that organization has provided invaluable insight as we have considered our decisions in this matter. We value and respect their opinion, and we look forward to continuing to work with them in the future.”
In Brown's second statement, which was released through the Giants, he apologized to the team but not to his wife, who endured years of abuse. This statement was very similiar to his initial one, but it removed his comment about never striking his wife.
""I am sorry that my past has called into question the character or integrity of The New York Giants, Mr. Mara or any of those who have supported me along the way,"" Brown said. ""I have taken measures to get help so that I may be the voice of change, not a statistic. It is important to share that I never struck my wife, and never would.
""Abuse takes many forms, and is not a gray area,” the statement continues. “Through the past several years I have worked to identify and rectify my own behaviors. The road to rehabilitation is a journey and a constant modification of a way of life. My journey will continue forever as a person determined to leave a positive legacy and I embrace the opportunities to show and speak about what has helped me to be that man. In the interim, I am cooperating with the Giants and the NFL. Thank you to everyone that has supported me, I will not let you down.""
Molly Brown claims that Josh Brown abused her as many as 20 times over the course of their relationship.
Brown landed on the commissioner’s exempt list Friday in the wake of the league re-opening its investigation. Two days prior, police released documents that included journal entries, allegedly kept by Brown, with admissions of abusing Molly Brown.
Brown was subsequently left behind for the Giants' trip to London and their 17-10 win over the Rams. The exempt list indefinitely bars any player from participating in practices or games and the player does not count against a team’s 53-man roster. Brown was paid while on the list.
Brown's release ends a months-long saga that has damaged the Giants' reputation as one of the model franchises in sports. In particular, Mara has come under considerable scrutiny for re-signing a player whom he knew had been arrested for domestic violence.
Brown was arrested for domestic violence in May of 2015. Charges were later dropped. Brown was suspended one game on Aug. 17 due to a violation of the NFL's personal conduct policy. Later that night, NJ.com obtained a police report detailing the incident, in which Josh Brown allegedly grabbed Molly Brown's wrist as she was reaching for a phone, leaving ""redness.""
The next day, Brown spoke with reporters and called the incident ""just a moment."" Coach Ben McAdoo — who said in January that domestic violence was the one thing he ""won't tolerate as a head coach"" — deflected questions about the team's decision to re-sign Brown. ""That's a better question for Jerry (Reese),"" he said.
Later that night, the Daily News uncovered an incident report in which Molly Brown told police of Josh being physically violent more than 20 times, including a 2009 incident when she was pregnant with their daughter. She also indicated to police that she previously held a protection order against Josh. In one alleged incident, Molly claims Josh got into an argument with her son and kicked in the bathroom door ""so hard that it broke off the hinges…and cracked a large portion of the door jam.""
Giants owner John Mara and coach Ben McAdoo come under considerable scrutiny for their support of Josh Brown.
On Aug. 19, the NFL released a statement detailing its 10-month investigation of Brown. In that statement, the league claims its investigators ""had insufficient information to corroborate prior allegations,"" and therefore only suspended Brown for one game. Molly Brown had refused to speak with the league regarding its investigation. Brown's suspension was five games shorter than the requisite six-game ban the NFL had instituted for first-time domestic violence offenders after the Ray Rice debacle in 2014.
Over the next several days, the Giants stayed quiet. McAdoo declined to the address Brown's domestic violence history during his press conference, while both Mara and Reese did not speak with the media.
Finally, on Aug. 24, Mara held an impromptu news conference at the Giants facility during a training camp practice. In that session, Mara admitted the organization was aware of Josh Brown's 2015 domestic violence arrest — as well as the kicker's alleged history of violent incidents revealed in the incident report — when the brain trust decided to re-sign him to a two-year, $4 million contract in the offseason.
""Based on the facts and circumstances that we were aware of at that time, we were comfortable with our decision to re-sign him,"" Mara said then. ""Nothing has happened in the meantime to make us question that decision.
""I have four daughters and seven sisters, and I know I've got to face each one of them. These are not easy decisions. It's very easy to say, 'The guy's been accused, get rid of him, terminate him.' But when you're sitting at the top of an organization and you're responsible for a lot of people, you'd better make more informed decisions than that.""
The following weekend, the Daily News obtained more police reports that revealed how Brown was arrested in July of 2015 — two months after his initial domestic violence arrest — for violating the protective order Molly Brown placed against him.
When asked for comment about whether the team was aware of Brown's second arrest, a Giants spokesman referenced Mara's comments from the press conference earlier in the week: “All I can tell you is that we are aware of all the allegations and, I believe, all of the facts and circumstances, and we were comfortable with our decision to re-sign him,” the owner said.
After serving a one-game suspension, Brown refused to speak with reporters during the week — a violation of the NFL's media policy — and kicked the game-winning field goal as time expired in Big Blue's 16-13 home win over the Saints.
""I have nothing to say about it. Literally nothing,"" Brown said after the game when asked about his domestic violence history. ""My family and I have moved on. My concern is my children and that's it. Everything that I said prior to the day my suspension came out is all I am going to say.""
Then came the bombshell when Washington police released documents they'd received from Molly Brown after Josh's arrest in May of 2015. Included in those documents was a journal Molly claimed belonged to Josh.
""I HAVE Abused my life,"" one line of the journal read.
""When I control her, she should be invisible and satisfied she should die,"" read another excerpt from the journal.
Another document was a ""contract for change"" signed by Josh, which was part of a counseling program. In the contract, Josh admits, ""I have physically, verbally and emotionally abused my wife Molly.""
In the documents, Josh also reveals he was molested as a seven-year-old child and had an ""addiction to porn and to sex.""
On Thursday, the Giants announced Brown would not be traveling to London. The team signed Robbie Gould to replace him.
""In light of the news reports regarding the documents released by the State of Washington yesterday, we think it makes sense to review this newly disclosed information and to revisit this issue following our trip to London,"" the team said in a statement. ""The Giants do not condone or excuse any form of domestic violence. Josh has acknowledged that he has issues in his life and has been working on these issues through therapy and counseling for a long period of time. We remain supportive of Josh and his efforts.""
The same day, the NFL announced the re-opening of their investigation. On Friday, they placed him on the commissioner's exempt list.
Now Brown's time in the NFL has likely come to a close.

Lisa Brown told blogger Christopher Elliott, who first broke the story, that she had attempted to cancel the cable portion of their Comcast bill in order to save money. While on the phone, Brown spoke with a “retention specialist” who tried to get her to keep the service.
“I was never rude,” she said. “It could have been that person was upset because I didn’t take the offer.”
When Brown received her bill soon after canceling her cable service, she was shocked to notice that her husband’s first name, Ricardo, had been replaced with the word “Asshole.” Brown was shocked and furious, and told Elliott that she was demanding that every dollar that she’d ever paid to Comcast be refunded. “This is unacceptable,” she said.
Comcast responded to the incident, saying that they would not tolerate such behavior. They eventually refunded Brown for the entire two years of services she and her husband paid for.
“We have spoken with our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change,” Comcast vice president of communications Steve Kipp said. “We have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened. We are working with our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again.”

Hit US Before Elections?,"Russia is all set for World War 3 with its powerful SS-18 “Satan” missile after its government official has warned the nation of the conflict expected to happen even before the US elections scheduled on November 8.
Russia’s Civic Chamber’s member Sergei Markov believes that the tensions between the United States and Russia have increased to such an extent that the situation can worsen anytime. He added that he is getting prepared for the Third World War, which is likely to happen anytime.
“These are the most serious tensions between Moscow and Washington in decades. The war might begin even before the November elections in the U.S,” he said. “I personally plan to stock 200 cans of pork to be ready for a potential war crisis, and I advise everybody to do the same.”
With the speculations and a considerable warning from top officials of the United States, Russia and Turkey regarding the commencement of the international war soon, Russia seems to prepare itself with Satan. It is the most powerful missile that is capable of destroying a large area as well as a large population. Reports have suggested that Russia already has 55 of this type of weapon in service.
According to experts, even a minimum of five of such weapons are capable of turning the East Coast of the United Stated into ashes. It is, however, believed that it is the same system that helped in dropping the nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki following the end of the Second World War.
Treasury for Economic Policy’s former assistant secretary Dr. Paul Craig Roberts predicted that if a Satan attack is carried in central New York, it will lead to the destruction of over four million lives, Daily Star stated. He claimed that if the Russian president’s Satan missiles are launched in the series of World War 3 attacks, they would effectively “wipe out three-quarters of New York state for thousands of years.”

60db7b03,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/philippines-president-backtracks-on-anti-u-s-tirade/,Philippines president backtracks on anti-U.S. tirade,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte delivers a speech during the Philippines-China Trade and Investment Forum at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing Thursday, Oct. 20, 2016. China and the Philippines have agreed to resume a dialogue on their dispute over the South China Sea, a senior Chinese diplomat said Thursday following talks between the countries’ leaders. WU HONG / POOL, AP
MANILA, Philippines - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said Friday he did not mean he would cut off ties with the United States when he said in China that he was separating from the U.S., adding it’s in his country’s best interest to stay with America.
Despite the clarification, the tough-talking president kept up on his tirades against the U.S., saying in a late-night speech in his southern hometown of Davao city that he would never travel to America “in this lifetime.”
At an economic forum Thursday in Beijing, where he made a state visit, Duterte declared “my separation from the United States ... both in military and economics also.” His pronouncement was met with applause, but Duterte did not explain what he exactly intended to do and when.
Philippines president wants U.S. troops out
Duterte, however, said in an arrival speech in Davao that he was not severing ties with his country’s treaty ally that is home to a large number of Filipino expatriates.
“When you say severance of ties, you cut the diplomatic relations. I cannot do that. Why? It’s to the best interest of my country that we maintain that relationship,” Duterte said, adding that Filipinos were not ready to embrace such an option.
What he meant by his remarks in China, Duterte said, was ending a Philippine foreign policy that closely leaned toward the U.S.
Ahead of his China visit, Duterte made a series of pronouncements to curb Philippine security engagements with the U.S., including the removal of American counterterrorism forces in the country’s south and his opposition to planned joint patrols with the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea. He also wanted to stop annual joint combat exercises the Philippines hosted alongside the U.S. military that China opposes.
Duterte has said he did not want to embroil the Philippines in an unwinnable war with China, which could instead be tapped as a major trading partner and source of development funds.
Also Friday, hundreds of Filipinos protesting Friday outside the presidential palace burned a mock U.S. flag and asked President Duterte to punish police officers for brutally dispersing an anti-U.S. rally and ramming a van into some of the activists.
Filipino tribal groups and activists shout slogans as they burn a mock U.S. flag near the Malacanang presidential palace in Manila, Philippines, Oct. 21, 2016. AP
U.S. officials said they have not received any formal Philippine notice of Duterte’s pronouncements, adding the alliance benefits both countries and should continue to blossom.
However, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday there had been “too many troubling public statements” by Duterte in recent months leading to uncertainty about his intent. He said that the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia would discuss that uncertainty when he travels to the Philippines this weekend.
U.S.-Philippine ties also got attention on the U.S. presidential campaign trail Friday. Republican candidate Donald Trump told a rally in North Carolina that the Philippine shift toward closer relations with China after decades of a pro-U.S. foreign policy showed that “America has grown weak.”
He said that the Philippines is a “very important strategic ally” and China and Russia “are probably going to take it.”
Duterte’s reaching out to China, which has been locked in longstanding territorial disputes with the Philippines in the South China Sea, and his severe criticisms of the U.S. has come under fire at home.
Former Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario, who brought the triumphant arbitration case against China over the disputes, said Duterte’s shift from Washington to Beijing should be regarded “a national tragedy.”
“The declared shift in foreign policy, casting aside a long-time reliable ally to hastily embrace an aggressive neighbor that vehemently rejects international law, is both unwise and incomprehensible,” del Rosario said in a statement.
“What is unfolding before us must be considered a national tragedy, which does not need to happen,” he said.
The criticism by del Rosario, a respected Asian diplomat, is among the strongest so far of Duterte’s declared policy to back away from America while reaching out to China and Russia. His main political ally, former President Fidel Ramos, has also criticized Duterte’s profane tirades against President Barack Obama and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
As the foreign secretary of Duterte’s predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, del Rosario spearheaded the filing of an arbitration case that challenged the validity of China’s claims to virtually the entire South China Sea. In its July ruling, the tribunal invalidated China’s claims under a 1982 U.N. treaty in an embarrassing defeat that Beijing has ignored.
The U.S. and its Western and Asian allies have called on China to respect the outcome.
At the end of Duterte’s trip to China, both countries announced in a joint statement several trade and business deals and closer cooperation on a range of concerns. They added they have resumed dialogue on the South China Sea.
There was no mention of the arbitration ruling or Duterte’s call for China to respect the rights of Filipinos to fish in the disputed Scarborough Shoal, where Beijing’s coast guard ships continue to drive them away. But both sides agreed to continue talking.
“Without prejudice to other mechanisms, a bilateral consultation mechanism can be useful, which will meet regularly on current and other issues of concern to either side on the South China Sea,” the joint statement said.

3daceac7,http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/10/tallulah-willis-gets-naked-masturbatey/,"Tallulah Willis Gets Naked, Masturbatey"," Tallulah Willis showed off all the goods - just about every last one of them - in a recent photo shoot with mega-talented celeb photographer, Tyler Shields. 
 This pic is so intense we're gonna make you wait for it. 
 About the shoot, Shields said, ""I only work with people who want to do something different.""
 ""Something different"" absolutely encapsulates just what Tallulah - the youngest - Willis is. 
 He continued, ""People, when they come to me, they want to do something interesting, something crazy.""
 ""Something where they're pushing themselves."" 
 Tyler's currently promoting his gorgeous book, Provocateur, which you can purchase on Amazon.
 The book features major celebs like Lindsay Lohan and Tamara Eccleston, and, of course, Tallulah Willis in her most primal form. 
 BOOM. 
 Have you recovered yet? It's okay - it took us a minute or 10, too.
 About Tallulah's photos, Shields said that he harbors only mild concern from the starlet's father, Die Hard franchise star Bruce Willis. 
 ""I think if [Bruce] had a problem with [Demi Moore's former racy shoots], he couldn't have been married to her and been okay with all of that,"" he reasoned. 
 ""Although,"" he said, ""It might be a bit different with his daughter, though."" 
 What we have to say about Bruce Willis, however, is ""too bad, so sad."" 
 Tallulah's a grown-ass woman at the age of 22 years old, and this isn't the first time she's shared racy snaps, or even had them taken. 
 She's entitled to do what she wants with her body, and if this is it, believe us - we are absolutely not complaining. 
 About his provocative shots, Shields concluded, ""Now, I don't want to do anything to do anything too crazy, but I want some of these girls coming up to do something just for the fun of it.""
 ""Just to make a statement,"" he said. 
 Tallulah definitely did that - and more, judging by the pic. 
 Willis has had her history of poor decision-making when it came to drugs, self-sabotage, and other substance abuse, but this decision to pose for Shields definitely does not fall under that umbrella. 
 Looking good, girl - and we're totally digging the hair!

297e6d6b,http://m.newsok.com/article/5523619?utm_source=NewsOK.com&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=ShareBar-Twitter,'Rodeo' takes attendees on wonderful ride,"Oklahoma City Ballet's fall production, ""Rodeo: A Triple Bill,"" took audiences on a wonderful ride, from the sublime beauty of George Balanchine's ""Serenade"" to the heartfelt fun of Agnes de Mille's ""Rodeo."" In addition to these two very different ballets, OKC Ballet Artistic Director Robert Mills offered a premiere of his new contemporary ballet, ""Our Private Rooms.""
Thursday evening's dress rehearsal opened with ""Serenade,"" which is a living piece of dance history. It is one of Balanchine's masterpieces and the first ballet he choreographed in America. When ""Serenade"" is danced well, there is a sense of inevitability with the movement, as if one could not imagine any other steps going with Tchaikovsky's music.
The ballet was beautifully performed Thursday night, with DaYoung Jung and Alvin Tovstogray dancing the leading roles. Though petite in stature, Jung's charismatic presence and radiant technique filled the stage. Tovstogray, a brilliant dancer in his own right, was a perfectly gallant partner, making their many lifts look effortless. The interweaving groups of dancers and the fluidity that characterize this ballet were performed well by the artists of the company.
""Our Private Rooms"" was next on the program, with another look at contemporary ballet. The stage space was delineated by narrow, white vertical tubes, which descended to mark each “room.” The floor of the stage was white, in contrast with most ballets that use black or dark gray flooring, which gave the ballet a brighter, airier feeling.
The ballet began, and ended, with the dancers leaping, sliding, turning, and running across the stage, giving one a sense of strangers rushing by on a crowded street. Then, we saw into their “private rooms” in a series of solos, duets and small groups dancing within boundaries newly defined by the stage set.
This ballet seemed to show a series different relationships. One of the most powerful sections was Room Five, a duet danced by Walker Martin and Richard Walters. The dancers were together, then each had a solo, and finally ended dancing together again, incorporating movement motifs from each solo. All in all, a thought-provoking work.
""Rodeo"" was a grand ending to the program, a lighthearted frolic of a ballet complete with Cowhands, Womenfolk, tap dancing and square dancing. A successful production of ""Rodeo"" leans heavily on the leading female role, The Cowgirl, vibrantly performed by Autumn Klein. Klein is an accomplished dancer/actress who captivated the audience from the moment she loped onto the stage. While the premise of the ballet is dated — a Cowgirl must wear a dress to get a guy — the ballet is still lots of fun.
Richard Walters danced the role of the Champion Roper and proved he's not only a talented actor but an excellent tap dancer, too. A program note says that he studied tap dance for nine years, and it shows. Walters and Klein had the audience rooting for them to get together, which they did in an exuberant finale with the whole cast.
OKC Ballet's fall production should not be missed. It's a program of beauty, contemplation and sheer fun.

The Hamilton-Middletown Journal-News reported that the manager of the Sonic Drive-In franchise where the photo was taken reported the incident this week, before the Middletown Health Department could contact the store.
Health department officials say the employee, who was fully dressed in the picture, acted without considering the health of the restaurant chain’s customers. Officials say the incident occurred sometime last Friday.
The drive-in’s manager told the health department that all of the ice was removed and the machine was thoroughly sanitized.

(Vernon Bryant/The Dallas Morning News)
Matt Mosley, contributor to SportsDayDFW.com and columnist for Texas Monthly, answered your questions in a recent live chat. Here are some highlights:
What's the biggest overreaction of the Cowboys' season so far?
Mosley: That this defense is decent. They hung in there nicely against Rodgers, who doesn't look like himself these days. I think this thing could get shredded in the coming weeks. The folks that are most surprised the defense has held up OK are actual Cowboys employees.
Lotta Romo contract talk this week. ""Could they trade him?"" ""Who would take him?"" ""Should they cut him?"" Tell us, what happens to him after this season?
Mosley: You don't HAVE to do anything. You could just hold onto him and have two excellent QBs on the roster. Or you can make him a June 1 cut and spread that cap hit over two seasons. That might make the most financial sense. I don't see the Cowboys getting a first-round pick for a QB with Romo's injury history. Folks will point to Bradford, but he's younger and doesn't seem to have the chronic-type things Romo has.
Do you believe the Cowboys when they say there is no timetable for Romo or are they stalling?
Mosley: I don't know if I'd call it stalling. Prescott does give them the luxury of slow-playing this thing a bit. It's better for everyone (including Tony's ego) to just bring him back slowly. There's no need to come out and say that Dak's remaining the starter. The locker room already thinks of him as the permanent starter this season. They don't need an announcement. Cowboys just want to keep riding this Dak wave.
Are we right to question Romo's future with the Cowboys or is it an overreaction at this point?
Mosley: How can you NOT question his future with the team? Dak Prescott has no intention of giving this job back. The team is functioning at a high level with him. I've had scouts tell me that a lot of QBs could flourish behind this line and with this RB. But Dak's the one getting it done. You don't mess with something like this. We'll see what happens with Tony next season. For now, this is Dak's team.
If you're the Cowboys this offseason, do you trade or cut Romo?
Mosley: I think you try to do right by him. It's hard to trade a 36-year-old QB who's had major back and shoulder issues. You'd probably just end up releasing him like the Colts did with Manning. Then he can meet with a few teams. Sean Payton would love him...if not for Brees. The Redskins might need a QB since they are franchising Cousins this season...

What makes the Viking landers' findings crucial? Pictured is the launch of Viking 1 in 1975. (Photo : NASA | Wikimedia Commons)

In 1975, NASA sent two probes on an 11-month journey to Mars to conduct studies of the red planet's geographical features and composition of Martian surface and atmosphere. The probes, Viking 1 and Viking 2, also conducted experiments that looked for signs of microbial life in the Martian soil.

In the 40 years since the experiments were performed, the general consensus among scientists is that the landers did not find conclusive evidence of life on Mars albeit the life-detection experiments had contradictory results.

One experiment showed the Martian soil was positive for metabolism while another experiment did not find trace of organic material in the soil.

In the Labeled Release experiment, scientists mixed soil picked up by the Viking probes with nutrient-rich water. The scientists hypothesized that if the soil contains signs of life, the microbes of the soil would metabolize the nutrients in the water. The microbes were metabolized releasing radioactive molecules, which suggest that the soil of Mars contained life.

Other Viking probe experiments, however, did not find signs of life. Since the landers did not find any trace of organic material, scientists wondered about the purpose of metabolism if there were no organic materials in the Martian soil. Scientists then concluded that metabolization could be attributed to nonbiological processes.

Now, two researchers have urged the scientific community to take another look at the 40-year-old studies of the soil on planet Mars.

Researchers Gilbert Levin from Arizona State University and Patricia Ann Straat from the U.S. National Institutes of Health contend that the NASA robots may have found signs of life on the red planet decades ago.

Levin and Straat said that the LR experiments must be re-examined in light of recent findings on the red planet, saying that biological processes could be responsible for the results of the LR experiments. NASA's recent findings of water, methane and other organic molecules in Mars, for instance, support the idea that biological processes are behind the results of the LR experiment.

""The absence of a nonbiological agent that satisfies all Viking findings, and in view of environmental evidence that Mars may well be able to support extant life, it seems prudent that the scientific community maintain biology as a viable explanation of the LR experimental results,"" the scientists wrote in the journal Astrobiology on Oct. 1.

""Biology should be held in the forefront of possible explanations for the LR results,"" they added, saying that in the interest of astronauts' health and safety, microbial life should be considered especially since the scientific community is set on exploring Mars.

Findings of the Viking landers are crucial in that other Mars experiments face potential contamination by previous landers. The Viking probes provided the only pristine Martian life-detection experiments.","experi,mar,planet,probe,lander,scientist,lr experi,soil,microbi,vike"

 Hillary Clinton has vaulted to a double-digit advantage in the inaugural ABC News 2016 election tracking poll, boosted by broad disapproval of Donald Trump on two controversial issues: His treatment of women and his reluctance to endorse the election’s legitimacy. 
 Likely voters by a vast 69-24 percent disapprove of Trump’s response to questions about his treatment of women. After a series of allegations of past sexual misconduct, the poll finds that some women who’d initially given him the benefit of the doubt have since moved away. 
 Fifty-nine percent of likely voters, moreover, reject Trump’s suggestion that the election is rigged in Clinton’s favor, and more, 65 percent, disapprove of his refusal to say whether he’d accept a Clinton victory as legitimate. Most strongly disapprove, a relatively rare result. 
 All told, Clinton leads Trump by 12 percentage points among likely voters, 50 to 38 percent, in the national survey, her highest support and his lowest to date in ABC News and ABC News/Washington Post polls. Gary Johnson has 5 percent support, Jill Stein 2 percent. 
 The results mark a dramatic shift from Clinton’s +4 points in the last ABC/Post poll Oct. 13. That survey was conducted after disclosure of an 11-year-old videotape in which Trump crudely described his sexual advances toward women, but before the events that have followed: A series of women saying he sexually assaulted them, which Trump has denied; his continued refusal to say whether he’d accept the election’s legitimacy; and the final debate, which likely voters by 52-29 percent say Clinton won. 
 This inaugural 2016 ABC News tracking poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, was conducted Thursday through Saturday among 1,391 adults, including 874 likely voters. This is the first in what will be daily ABC News tracking poll reports from now to Election Day. The Washington Post will join ABC’s tracking survey later this week. 
 The previous ABC/Post poll found a sharp 12-point decline in enthusiasm for Trump among his supporters, almost exclusively among those who’d preferred a different GOP nominee. Intended participation now has followed: The share of registered Republicans who are likely to vote is down 7 points since mid-October. 
 Vote preference results among some groups also are striking. Among them: 
 • Clinton leads Trump by 20 percentage points among women, 55-35 percent. She's gained 12 points (and Trump's lost 16) from mid-October among non-college-educated white women, some of whom initially seemed to rally to Trump after disclosure of the videotape. 
 • Clinton has doubled her lead to 32 points, 62-30 percent, among college-educated white women, a group that’s particularly critical of his response to questions about his sexual conduct. (Seventy-six percent disapprove, 67 percent strongly.) 
 • That said, Clinton's also ahead numerically (albeit not significantly) among men, 44-41 percent, a first in ABC News and ABC/Post polling. 
 • Trump is just +4 among whites overall, 47-43 percent, a group Mitt Romney won by 20 points in 2012. Broad success among whites is critical for any Republican candidate; nonwhites, a reliably Democratic group, favor Clinton by 54 points, 68-14 percent. 
 Even with the gender gap in candidate support, the results show damage to Trump across groups on the issue of his sexual conduct. While 71 percent of women disapprove of his handling of questions about his treatment of women, so do 67 percent of men. And 57 percent overall disapprove “strongly” – 60 percent of women, but also 52 percent of men. By partisan group, 41 percent of Republican likely voters disapprove of Trump on this question, a heavy loss in one’s own party. That grows to 70 percent of independents and nearly all Democrats, 92 percent. 
 For comparison, 59 percent of likely voters disapprove of Clinton’s handling of questions about her email practices while secretary of state, including 31 percent of Democrats, 65 percent of independents and 84 percent of Republicans. Forty-five percent overall disapprove strongly, again a high level, if well fewer than strongly disapprove of Trump on the misconduct issue. 
 On Trump’s claim of a “rigged” election, 23 percent of Republican likely voters say he’s trying to make excuses in case he loses, rather than raising a legitimate concern; this view swells to 57 percent among independents and 91 percent among Democrats. That said, 74 percent of Republicans, and 84 percent of Trump supporters, say it’s a legitimate issue. 
 Further, one in three Republicans – 34 percent – disapprove of Trump’s refusal to say whether he’d accept the election’s outcome if Clinton won. That jumps to 65 percent of independents and, again, 91 percent of Democrats. Not only do 65 percent overall disapprove, but 53 percent feel strongly about it. 
Methodology
 This ABC News poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Oct. 20-22, 2016, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 874 likely voters. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 36-27-31 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents.

595678eb,http://fortune.com/2016/10/19/donald-trump-people-magazine-1998/?xid=soc_socialflow_twitter_FORTUNE,Melania Trump’s Legal Threat to People Magazine Is Puzzling Experts,"She disputes that a reporter squeezed baby Barron’s foot.
A threatening letter from a much-feared defamation lawyer to People magazine and one of its former writers, concerning an article she wrote alleging that Donald Trump made unwanted sexual advances towards her, has some media lawyers puzzled.
“I have seen many letters threatening legal action based on news reports,” wrote Theodore Boutrous, Jr., co-chair of litigation at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, in an email to Fortune, “and this has to rank as one of the weakest of all time.” (People is a sister publication of Fortune; both are published by Time Inc. I’ve never met Stoynoff or the People editors involved with her story.)
Boutrous also called the threat of legal action “empty and frivolous,” and suggested that it could only have been filed to improperly intimidate news organizations from reporting on an important news story.
At the same time, one defamation scholar defended the letter as raising a “plausible” claim, and “well within the norms of responsible media law practice.”
The letter on behalf of Melania Trump, first published by Politico, was sent last Thursday by Charles Harder, a Beverly Hills attorney who won a $140 million verdict in May against Gawker online gossip site on behalf of Hulk Hogan. That suit forced Gawker into bankruptcy, sale, and closure.
The most striking thing about Harder’s letter is what it doesn’t do. It doesn’t mention the crux of Stoynoff’s accusations at all. It doesn’t, for instance, take issue with her recollection that when she was interviewing Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in December 2005, while she was working on an article about the first anniversary of his marriage to Melania, he allegedly led her into an empty room under false pretenses, shut the door, pushed her up against a wall, kissed her aggressively, and predicted that they would have an affair—all while the pregnant Melania was momentarily upstairs, changing, during a pause in the joint interview.
(When Stoynoff’s article was published last Wednesday, People reported that a Trump spokeswoman asserted that the entire account “never happened” and was “fabricated.” On the campaign trail, Trump has also suggested that Stoynoff was not attractive enough to have allured him.)
Harder’s letter, however, only takes aim at the seemingly innocuous passages of Stoynoff’s article in which she described a friendly, chance encounter with Melania in front of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue nearly a year after the alleged assault. As Stoynoff recalled it, Melania was then carrying baby Barron in her arms. She gave Stoynoff a hug, and asked her, “Natasha, why don’t we see you anymore?” Stoynoff responded that she’d missed Melania, and she squeezed baby Barron’s foot, she wrote.
Harder, who identifies himself in the letter as representing only Melania, alleges that this passage was “completely fictionalized,” that the encounter with Melania didn’t occur, that Melania and Stoynoff were “not friends . . . or even friendly,” and that Melania “would not have even recognized Ms. Stoynoff if they had encountered one another.” Harder demanded a retraction and indicated that the failure to issue one would require Melania “to consider her legal options”—though he didn’t say what those might be.
According to People editor Jess Cagle, neither the magazine nor Stoynoff has, so far, received any threat from any lawyer representing Donald Trump.
“It’s hard to see any legitimate basis or purpose for Mr. Harder’s letter,” wrote Boutrous. “There is nothing defamatory about that statement [about Melania] and the letter doesn’t even claim that it is. In fact, the statement (indeed, the whole article) portrays Mrs. Trump in a positive light and did not even arguably damage her reputation.” (Elsewhere in the article, Stoynoff, who said she had been assigned to the Trump beat for some time prior to the alleged incident, described Melania in her article as “kind and sweet during our many chats.”)
Vincent Blasi, a first amendment and civil liberties scholar at Columbia law school, said in an email that he was puzzled “why, of all the things published about Donald Trump in conjunction with his alleged groping, this seemingly friendly, cordial exchange with Melania should be singled out for a demand for retraction.”
“My best guess,” Blasi offered, “is that Trump’s and/or Melania’s lawyers have been told by Melania that she remembers no such incident, and they believe that Melania has much more credibility than Donald so that any kind of denial by Melania would discredit Stoynoff. Surely the content of the exchange is in no way defamatory of anyone.”
On the other hand, Rodney Smolla, a first amendment scholar and dean of the Delaware Law School at Widener University, defended Harder’s letter in an email to Fortune, arguing that if Melania can prove that the incident was fabricated, she might have a “plausible false-light invasion of privacy claim.” (Such a case can arise when someone is “unreasonably” presented to the public in a way that leaves a false impression, causing them emotional harm.)
Such a claim “can be predicated on falsehoods that do not damage reputation,” Smolla explained, “or even falsehoods that portray the plaintiff in a sympathetic light. The test is whether under the circumstances the allegedly false portrayal would be ‘highly offensive to a reasonable person.’
“On a human level,” Smolla continued, “one can easily understand how Melania Trump might be deeply offended by a fictionalized account of an encounter that depicted her as being friends with Stoynoff, who allegedly was the victim of a sexual assault by her husband, if in fact Melania Trump never had such an encounter with Stoynoff, never said the words attributed to her, and never was holding her child while Stoynoff affectionately squeezed his foot. Whether this ultimately would be enough to support an actual recovery or not would be a question for judges or jurors to decide if the matter were ever actually litigated.”
Boutrous, on the other hand, maintains that there is “no conceivable basis” for a false-light invasion of privacy claim based on these allegations. What Stoynoff wrote about Melania “does not come close to being “highly offensive to a reasonable person,” he said.
“This threat of legal action is especially empty and frivolous because Mrs. Trump is a public figure,” he continued. For that reason, he says, People is protected by constitutionally heightened protections against “any legal theory Mr. Harder could conjure up.” It would face, for instance, a high standard of proof that it “knew that the statement was false or recklessly disregarded the truth, even though it had a first-hand account from an experienced and respected reporter.”
“The sole purpose of the letter seems to be to intimidate People and other news organizations and journalists from engaging in rigorous reporting about Mr. Trump’s activities, which is not a proper purpose,” he said.
Blasi acknowledged that he wasn’t an expert on false-light invasion of privacy claims. Nevertheless, he wrote, “I doubt whether even if the exchange outside Trump Tower never happened, saying that it did inflicts any kind of harm on Melania.”
In response to a request for comment, Harder wrote in an email: “I agree with what Dean Rod Smolla had to say. He writes the law school textbooks and legal treatises on defamation, and takes a balanced view. By contrast, partners at massive law firms like Gibson Dunn who do nothing but practice media company defense are virtually required to give you the defense bar perspective, and only that. They would probably lose clients if they said anything balanced or, heaven forbid, favorable to an individual who is the subject of a false story.”
Meanwhile, the Stoynoff story continues to develop. On Monday night, Melania Trump told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the accusations of all her husband’s accusers were “lies.”
Then, on Tuesday evening, People revealed the names and accounts of six named sources who corroborate Stoynoff’s account, including a friend who says she was with Stoynoff when they met Melania on Fifth Ave. “They chatted in a friendly way,” that friend, Liza Herz, told People. “And what struck me most was that Melania was carrying a child and wearing heels.”

Understandably, parents are furious and want an explanation for the clear lack of supervision over their children.
There are few contextual details available here. All that’s known is that the seven girls, all ages 13 to 15, became pregnant on the trip. While parents are demanding explanations for the lack of supervision, health officials in the country say the news is indicative of another problem in the country: sexual education.
Students in Bosnia and Herzegovina receive little, if any, sexual education. Senad Mehmedbasic, a Bosnian gynecologist, says underage pregnancies are a big problem in the country as a result.
“That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,” he told Inserbia.info. “It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences.
“We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that [the] street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.”

A brigadier general in the Egyptian army was shot dead on Saturday outside his home in a Cairo suburb. The officer, Adel Rajaei, 52, had commanded the army’s 9th brigade in northern Sinai, where the army has been confronting terrorist groups, including an affiliate of ISIS. The brigade was also working to destroy smuggling tunnels that have been built under the Egyptian border with the Gaza Strip. 
According to the Egyptian media, witnesses, including Rajaei's wife, say that unknown individuals ambushed the army officer at the entrance to his building in Obour City near Cairo. They opened fire as he walked toward his car, killing him instantly. 
The general's wife, Samia Zain El Abedeen, said she could see the face of one of the assailants, who then fled on a motorcycle with no license plates. Abedeen is known in Egypt for her work as a military reporter and has been critical of extremist Salafi Muslim organizations as well as the Muslim Brotherhood. 
In a message on Twitter, a group that identified itself as the Revolutionary Brigade claimed responsibility for the killing. Egyptian security sources said that the group was associated with extremist Islamic organizations active in Egypt, and that the killing appeared to be revenge for Rajaei’s military role. 
The assassination was the top news in Egypt on Saturday and also featured prominently on Arab social media, particularly since carrying it out required the attackers to track Rajaei’s whereabouts. A senior Egyptian national security source told Haaretz that if the killing was indeed related to Rajaei’s role in northern Sinai, it would represent a new stage in the battle between the authorities and terrorist groups in the peninsula. 
Up until now, most of the terrorist groups’ activities have been directed against police and army positions in the northern part of Sinai. The killing of such a high-ranking army officer at his home near Cairo would require the country’s security establishment to thoroughly investigate the incident. 
The killing of Rajaei came several hours before an Egyptian appeals court rejected an appeal filed by ousted Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi. The court also confirmed his 20-year prison term after he was found responsible for the deaths of demonstrators during protests in June 2012.

On November 2010, Assange was requested to be extradited to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning concerning an allegation of rape. Assange denied the allegation and has expressed concern that he would be extradited from Sweden to the United States due to his perceived role in publishing secret American documents.
After exhausting his legal options in the United Kingdom, Assange did not surrender for extradition. Rather, he sought and was granted asylum by Ecuador in August 2012. Assange has since remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, and is unable to leave without being arrested for breaching his bail conditions.
The United Nations' Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found, by a majority, that he has been ""arbitrarily detained"" and that his detention should be brought to an end; UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the UN conclusion was ""ridiculous"", that the group was ""made up of lay people"", and called Assange a fugitive from justice. On October 17, 2016, the state of Ecuador cut Assange's internet access in the embassy.

669625f3,http://www.inquisitr.com/3559867/the-voice-ratings-miley-cyrus/,‘The Voice’ Ratings Are Sliding — Is Miley Cyrus To Blame?,"  TV 
NBC’s The Voice might be the most viewed network show on Mondays and Tuesdays, but its ratings are slowly dropping. Is the roundly-boycotted Miley Cyrus to blame?
Not exactly. Cyrus’s presence could be partly to blame for The Voice’s ratings slide. However, comparisons between the current and past seasons prove she’s not entirely at fault.
You see, The Voice is in the early stages of a serious ratings problem. In fact, Voice ratings have slid consistently for the past few years.
Still, the Voice remains a bright star in the NBC weekday line-up. According to TV By The Numbers, The Voice was a solid performer last week, especially among the much-coveted 18-49 demographic. Although The Voice finished behind The Big Bang Theory on Monday night, it handily recovered the top spot on Tuesday.
The trouble arises when you begin to compare this week’s numbers with past performances. The Futon Critic has Voice ratings down 5.88 percent from last week, and down 11.11 percent from this time last year.
All things considered, there are three key takeaways from the Voice’s mounting ratings drama.
The ‘New Era’ Is A Flop 
The Voice ditched not one, but two coaches. The hope was to re-launch the show with a “fresh” image — two women Voice judges for the first season ever. The Voice brought on previous guest mentors Miley Cyrus and Alicia Keys to make season-long contributions to the show.
It was especially hoped that Cyrus, as the youngest and most pop culture-relevant judge, would bring in a slew of young viewers. Except…that didn’t happen. While ratings didn’t dramatically plummet in protest to her presence, they didn’t surge in response, either. The Voice simply continued to quietly hemorrhage audience members.
Again, the Voice is only in the earliest stages of a ratings issue. That means there’s time to figure out what’s holding the show back and change it.
The “Anti-Miley Cyrus Brigade” Is Winning 
Did you hate the idea of Miley Cyrus joining The Voice? If so, you are entitled to feel vindicated for the moment. With ratings down from last season, it’s possible to argue that Cyrus’s addition either hurt the show’s numbers directly or didn’t benefit The Voice as hoped.
It also doesn’t help that rumors continue to circulate that Miley Cyrus is a disruptive force behind the scenes. If Cyrus is indeed feuding with other judges while offering nothing regarding viewership, this could be her first and last season of The Voice.
The Voice May Have Jumped The Shark
As previously predicted by the Inquisitr, it’s possible The Voice may have “jumped the ratings shark.” That means that The Voice ultimately squandered its competition’s viability by doing nothing of note with the show’s nearly dozen winners.
Most winners have faded outright into obscurity, and most Voice finalists largely suffered the same fate. Compare that to the defunct American Idol which launched dozens of careers — regardless of whether the singers actually won!
By marketing itself as a ground-breaking singing competition and failing to make stars, The Voice may be turning off viewers for good. The Voice is still a popular show, but it’s clear that the novelty factor has worn off.
What does all of this ultimately mean for The Voice? Well, while Miley Cyrus’s presence hasn’t outright doomed the series, she’s not exactly bringing the “younger” crowd on board. The ongoing ratings slide also means the source or sources of The Voice’s downward trend have yet to be properly addressed.
Do you think Miley Cyrus is the source of ratings problems for The Voice? Why do you think The Voice is losing viewers? Share your thoughts below!

In a recently released email by WikiLeaks from Clinton campaign Chair John Podesta’s email account, Podesta, Clinton aide Cheryl Mills, and political strategist David Plouffe share a document entitled “Road Map Outline,” outlining strategies to consider in developing Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The email illuminates how early Clinton began the foundation for her inevitable rise to the top of the Democratic Party.
Pro-Clinton pundits and supporters first dismissed the WikiLeaks releases as fake, then amended their arguments to downplay the revelations as just politics. The manner in which Clinton consolidated political power in the Democratic Party and elite circles throughout the country was carefully calculated and downright Machiavellian. All in all, it was a stark contrast to the totalitarianism a democracy is supposed to protect against.
Current DNC Chair Donna Brazile said in a 2013 interview with ABC News, “if Hillary Clinton gets into the race, there will be a coronation of her.” A 2013 poll conducted by The Hill found a majority of voters believed Clinton was running for president, with 41 percent believing she would be the nominee. Other polls conducted in 2013 found similar results.
The Washington Post called 2013 Clinton’s “pre-campaign campaign,” as she spent her first year out of serving as secretary of state on the award and speech circuit. Clinton received at least 19 awards from various organizations that year, ranging from Sir Elton John’s foundation to the American Bar Association. Even Bill Clinton received a “Father of the Year” award from the National Father’s Day Council—though his only child was a full grown adult. The organizations bestowing awards upon Hillary Clinton were afforded access to her vast network of wealthy donors and corporate connections. In exchange, she was provided a public spotlight without any political risk.
By 2013, the mainstream media was already obsessed with the idea of Clinton becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. Polls, articles and speculation about her presumed campaign were frequently discussed. Barbara Walters dubbed her “the most fascinating person of 2013.” Despite the Benghazi scandal looming over her actions as secretary of state during regime change in Libya, Clinton’s support among Democrats was described as “nearly unanimous” by The Washington Post, according to a poll they conducted with ABC News. The same sentiments were shared throughout the mainstream media.
By the end of 2014, no Democrats who could pose a serious challenge to Clinton in the primaries displayed any interest in running against her for president. In her failed 2008 presidential bid against Barack Obama, Clinton also had to run against Sen. John Edwards. Edwards split the votes in the beginning of the primaries between himself, Obama and Clinton, ultimately dropping out after he was unable to score any victories against the two frontrunners. Edwards would later endorse Obama, despite reports Clinton offered him a position as attorney general in exchange for his support.
Most presidential candidates don’t run because they believe they have a favorable chance of winning their party’s nomination. Presidential primaries offer candidates opportunities for publicity and support, which could prove beneficial in future presidential bids in the form of being selected as a running mate for the winner, or help improve political stature in their current office.
The size and scope of the Clinton Democratic machine made challenging Clinton in the primaries potentially more damaging than beneficial. In the book HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton, authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes note that Bill Clinton intervened in 2012 midterm Democratic primary elections to help candidates who supported his wife over Obama in 2008. Clinton’s service as secretary of state, and the increased growth and influence of the Clinton Foundation made it more politically viable for Democrats to ally with the Clintons rather than force Hillary into a contested primary campaign.
Had the presidential field been as filled as the Republican primaries, Clinton may have seen the same fate as former Gov. Jeb Bush, who was initially the Republican front runner due to his name recognition, and treasure chest of wealthy donors willing to pour millions into his campaign. Clinton’s supporters would have been split among several other candidates and the Democratic Party establishment would have been less aligned with her from the beginning. Instead, the consensus both within the Democratic Party, and in the mainstream media, was “it’s her turn,” and everyone else should just step aside.

Rihanna was working on a new collection of socks for her collaboration with Stance, would Karman illustrate the campaign?
Needless to say, Karman accepted the assignment. Inspired by Japanese street style, the Stance collection made its debut last week, accompanied by a series of Karman’s illustrations of a geisha-fied Rihanna in repose, wearing the socks from her collection. Karman pulled the lush color palette of deep plum, mint green, sherbet orange, and sage from the socks themselves, incorporating their floral motifs into kimonos and background details. 
“Female musicians often have such a strength about them,” Karman said. In addition to these images of Rihanna, she also frequently paints musicians from the ’60s like Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez, and Nico. “They’re such personalities,” she explained. “There’s just so much to work with.”
Nor was the street style angle too much of a stretch for the illustrator; Karman was already a fan of the Harajuku street style zine Fruits and the work of contemporary designers like Rei Kawakubo at Comme Des Garçons and Junya Watanabe. She pulled historical reference imagery and consulted the work of Japanese designers to inform her illustrations, right down to kimono silhouettes and shoe design.
“I didn’t want to do anything that was culturally insensitive,” she said. “I wanted to make sure it was true to Japan.” The resulting paintings merge traditional elements and a bit of a contemporary update.
The Stance campaign was the most recent development in a lifelong interest in fashion for Karman. The 24-year-old illustrator — and prolific zine artist — once envisioned herself as a designer, but fell in to illustration after entering Pasadena’s Art Center College of Design.
“Fashion was always my number-one interest,” she explained. “I realized I’m more a kind of person who needs to be in their studio working alone instead of on a set or something.” Illustration has allowed her to merge the two worlds, painting and fashion design: Her clients have included international fashion magazines and brands like Converse; while still in school, she designed a display for the opening of Italian brand Peuterey’s first Parisian flagship; and in her spare time, she illustrates models in recent collections by the likes of Gucci, Simone Rocha, and J.W.Anderson.
Karman is still riding out the wave of attention her collaboration with Stance has brought, but she’s also onto the next project. The consummate collaborator, she’s preparing for a Los Angeles-themed group show at the city’s Co-LAb gallery and a t-shirt design with Silver Lake boutique Hemingway and Sons.
Though she’s most at home alone in the studio, she still recognizes what collaborators offer. “It’s always a new challenge working with other people,” she said. “It just brings something out of left field that I wouldn’t usually think to do.”

It is not the Russian government. Mark this day — it is when we came to understand that the American government decided to elect a president.
(Note: I understand in the minds of the mass media the most important issue in America today is Trump’s crude remarks, but there are indeed real things to be concerned about otherwise.)
Here’s how:
— Two days before the second presidential debate, the government of the United States officially accused Russia of a hacking campaign aimed at interfering in the U.S. election. In a joint statement, absent any specifics or technical details, the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence stated “the recent [hacked email] disclosures… are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts… based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.”
— The statement goes on to detail how only Democratic servers were attacked, meaning the American government is claiming that Russia is trying to throw the election to Donald Trump, plain and simple. It is left unsaid why the Russians would risk cyberwar with the United States to do this, as many have suggested Trump is a neocon in spirit whose loose finger will be on the nuclear button from day one. Clinton is much more of a political realist, comfortable with the business-as-usual of the past eight years that has gone in Russia’s favor in the Ukraine and Syria. She in fact seems like the stable known known, always a preference.
— Though the first “Russian” hacks were reported in July, it is only 48 hours before the second presidential debate that the statement was released. It could easily have been held until Monday, there is no national security urgency for this to come out Friday. However, with the timing, Trump, essentially tied with Clinton in the polls, will now spend much of the debate defending himself. Since the statement includes no details, only accusations, it is hard to see how anyone could defend themselves. It would be near-impossible for Trump to come out ahead Sunday night; this is a near-coup.
— Despite the certainty with which the U.S. government has accused Russia of trying to influence the election by hacking into secured email servers, the FBI maintains there is no evidence the Russians or anyone else accessed Clinton unsecured, unencrypted email server laden with actual classified materials, including during Clinton’s first trip to Moscow when she sent and received encrypted email over the Internet and WiFi.
— In the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton broadly speculated that Donald Trump had paid no taxes. Days later, several pages of Trump’s tax returns, documents that had been sought unsuccessfully by the media for over a year, arrive at the New York Times, who front pages a story. In the Vice Presidential debate which followed, Trump’s running mate spent time on the defensive defending his boss’ deductions.
— Clinton sent and received classified material on an unsecured, classified server. That violated the most basic rule of information security. She lied about it. She deleted emails and “lost” both the majority of her devices and many, many emails. The FBI and the Department of Justice, ahead of the Democratic nominating convention, found she violated no law. The Department of Justice granted broad immunity to key Clinton staffers, and allowed two of them to destroy their devices. No further investigation will thus be possible.
— The State Department aided and abetted Clinton for over four years in hiding her private server, and avoiding her responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act and the Federal Records Act. Only under court order has the Department stopped slow-walking its “review” process to release emails publically. There has been no investigation.
— Emails released show a tangle of interests among State Department decisions, the Clinton Foundation and access to Hillary as Secretary of State (“pay for play”). Clinton sought Pentagon and State Department contracts for Chelsea’s friend. There has been no investigation.
— The State Department and White House coordinated to “crush” Clinton’s email coverage.
If you can add it up any other way than direct interference by the White House, the State Department, the Department of Justice, the FBI and the intelligence community in this election, it would be interesting to hear how that works. The comments are open to make a benign case for these actions.

The only thing that might be different in the Amway Center is the lighting.
On Jan. 25, 2015, Rudez scored 18 points on 7-for-10 shooting including 4-for-7 shooting from beyond the arc. The Indiana Pacers turned a deficit entering the fourth quarter into an easy win over the rebuilding Orlando Magic.
Rudez joked during media day that everything looked the same inside the building. There was already something of a comfort level.
Then against the Pacers in last Friday’s preseason game, Rudez went off again. He scored 15 points on 4-for-6 shooting, sparking a 44-point second quarter that ignited the team and led to a victory with the starters playing to the end.
“Maybe our highest IQ player on the team,” coach Frank Vogel said after that game last week. “He just really has a great feel for the game. He’s a knock down shooter so there is a reason he’s here. He has had a great camp for us.”
The joke between Rudez and Vogel, dating from their days in Indiana is that Rudez can stay in so long as he does not miss. That joke continues.
But it shows the kind of instant offense Rudez can provide for a team. A theme that was pretty consistent throughout the preseason.
Each time he stepped on the floor, it felt like good things were going to happen. That is a big reason Rudez will make the Magic roster, Adrian Wojnarowski of The Vertical reports.
Forward Damjan Rudez has made the Orlando Magic's opening night roster, league sources tell @TheVertical.
— Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) October 22, 2016
This preseason, Rudez averaged 5.0 points per game in six preseason games in 14.4 minutes per game. He shot 55.6 percent from the floor and 57.1 percent from beyond the arc. This is the kind of player Rudez is. Instant offense as a stretch-4.
“I’m just trying to do what I’ve been doing for years,” Rudez said. “I’m trying to have fun out there and enjoy and most of all have good decision making and prove I can be a reliable part of any team, just contribute in a good way with my outside shot, passing the ball and be a good team player. The decision is not up to me. We’re all trying to do our best to be a part of the team and make a name for ourselves.”
Rudez is not likely to get a ton of playing time. Rudez could be good for moments when they need instant offense. But he undoubtedly struggled last year with the Minnesota Timberwolves — just 9.7 points per 36 minutes on 54.0 percent effective field goal percentage in 33 games last year.
The 30-year-old forward has only two NBA seasons under his belt, but still is viewed something of a veteran. He certainly keeps things light.
Mario Hezonja played with Rudez on the Croatian National Team and considered him a key veteran for the team and his career as he started his career with the international team.
“On the national team, he was one of the really few guys that was close to me and approached me in a really friendly way,” Mario Hezonja said. “That’s what I really respect from him. That’s why I’m trying to give it back to him right now because he really deserves respect from me. I want to push him on the team. I want him to stay here and be in the NBA. As a player and as a person, especially, he deserves that I take care of the stuff that can be taken care of from my side.”
Rudez could end up being something of a security blanket. A veteran shooter they can rely on to help keep the team loose off the court and spark them on the court. He has already done that in the preseason games he appeared in.
His familiarity with coach Frank Vogel also could be a help. Vogel said he asked the Magic to look into Rudez’s availability heading into camp. That comfort certainly helped him with this second chance with Vogel.
“He knows very well what I can do,” Rudez said. “He used me a lot on the court. I’m just trying to make good plays out there and good reads. I think passing is very good and contagious. I’m trying to have good decision making on the court. I feel his confidence in me. It’s always easier to play when your coach has confidence in you.”
Rudez is not going to get a ton of playing time. The Magic have Serge Ibaka starting at power forward. Bismack Biyombo will get his turn at the position too. As will Aaron Gordon. The minutes for Rudez will be sparse.
But when he comes in, as the Magic learned two years ago, Rudez can get hot and change a game’s energy with his shooting.

Hillary Clinton temporarily overcame her severe allergy to press conferences after the final presidential debate, holding an impromptu gathering with members of the press on her plane, only to cut it short the instant someone brought up the bird-dogging scandal brought to light in James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas videos.
“I know nothing about this. I can’t deal with every one of his conspiracy theories,” said Clinton of the videos, Real Clear Politicsreports. “But I hope you all have something to eat and drink on the flight back to New York.”

Now, leaving aside for the moment the drop-dead hilarious claim that she “knows nothing about” a series of videos that even her propaganda syndicates like CNN have been forced to cover due to intractable public interest, two of the main figures featured in O’Keefe’s videos were fired. They were shown describing in lengthy, comic book supervillain-like monologues their involvement with a conspiracy to provoke violence at Donald Trump rallies in front of the media on behalf of the Democratic party, and then when the videos surfaced, they lost their jobs. That’s not a “theory”. That’s just a thing that happened.
The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines conspiracy as “a secret plan made by two or more people to do something that is harmful or illegal,” so it is certainly appropriate for the Clinton campaign and its corporate media cronies to paint such things as conspiracies, since per definition that is what they are. But to describe a lengthy clip of video featuring a man bragging about something for which he is immediately made jobless as a “theory” is absurd.
A better example of a conspiracy theory would be the convoluted line of reasoning that leads people to believe that leaked documents can be both fake and stolen at the same time, simultaneously forged and pirated as a part of a grand conspiracy by Kremlin operatives that has yet to be substantiated or explained. That’s the sort of screaming-at-cars nutso theorizing you need to make a tinfoil hat to even think about.

But stuff like how leaked emails prove the DNC violated the Impartiality Clause of its Charter by conspiring to subvert the Bernie Sanders campaign and install Hillary Clinton as the nominee? Or how WikiLeaks has shown again and again the elites of the Democratic party conspiring with the upper echelons of a wide breadth of news media organizations to manipulate public perception of Clinton and to elevate Donald Trump above the other candidates in the Republican primary? Those aren’t conspiracy theories. Those are conspiracy facts.
It’s not a “theory” that when the DNC leaks first dropped, the Committee issued an apology, the staff involved in the most egregious correspondences resigned, and Clinton and her media goons began painting Russia as the bad guy for showing Americans the truth. It is an undeniable fact that American democracy was assaulted in that way.
And yet every day we hear the Clinton campaign and its accomplices make use of the term “conspiracy theory” to try and invalidate such revelations, to try and gaslight everyone into thinking the folks shining a light on their misdeeds are the crazy ones, and to give themselves a raft to float on in the immense sea of cognitive dissonance they must surely be experiencing.
Cognitive dissonance is the mental stress or discomfort experienced as a result of the effort required to employ conflicting perspectives at the same time, which the great prophet George Orwell called “doublethink”. A good example of Orwellian doublethink being employed in a manner straight out of the book 1984 today is how each shocking revelation by WikiLeaks is invariably greeted by a chorus of “That’s not news, that’s just normal politics, I actually like her more now that I’ve read that” from Clinton accomplices, who immediately prior to the leak drop were calling us crazy conspiracy theorists for saying that, for example, Donald Trump was deliberately pushed to the forefront of the Republican race in a conspiracy between the Clinton campaign and their corporate media subordinates. That’s some high-level mental gymnastics right there, and the effort required can put a high degree of strain on one’s psychological comfort.

The means by which Hillary supporters cope with this strain is called compartmentalization. In compartmentalizing two conflicting ideas, like the notion that Donald Trump is a scary lunatic who mustn’t be trusted with the nuclear codes when Hillary Clinton is the one who keeps pushing for war with a nuclear superpower, they set up a kind of mental barrier between the two concepts, refusing to allow them to interact on a conscious level. That’s why debating a Hillary supporter can be like trying to hold down a firehose, because they’ll twist and turn every which way to avoid looking at the conflicting nature of those two concepts.
And make no mistake, they absolutely have to do this in order to support Hillary Clinton. Their psychological comfort depends upon it; they’d drown in cognitive dissonance if they didn’t. The tribal dynamics of identity politics have made it more psychologically comfortable to compartmentalize and keep everything unconscious than the sense of alienation that stepping back from their ideological identifications would bring about. Humans, like all primates, are tribal creatures, and the prospect of stepping away from your tribe can be terrifying.
So in that sense their bizarre mental contortions aren’t really their fault; they’re just doing their best with the psychological equipment they’ve got. But let’s not let anyone get away with painting us as the crazy ones.

2c5e8c57,http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/nobody_s_like_hitler_but_trump_is_getting_closer.html,Let’s Just Say It: Trump Sounds More and More Like Hitler,"Donald Trump speaks in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Thursday.
If a debate goes on long enough, some idiot will draw a Nazi analogy. That maxim, known as Godwin’s law, has deterred most journalists from comparing today’s politicians to Adolf Hitler. But sometimes, what brings the Nazi analogy closer isn’t the length of the discussion. It’s the behavior of the politician. That’s what is now happening in the case of Donald Trump.
In Godwin’s honor, let’s stipulate: There will never be another psychopath quite like Hitler. The German dictator preached such overt hatred, murdered so many people, and earned such infamy that every demagogue since, from Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to David Duke, has learned to draw at least tactical distinctions between himself and the Führer.
Then there’s Trump. He’s a salesman, not a fanatic. He doesn’t foist his hatreds on others. Instead, he reads and plays to the resentments of his crowds. He tells them that President Obama was born in Kenya, that Ted Cruz is a Canadian-born Cuban, and that Ben Carson is a Seventh-day Adventist. Trump will go after a Mexican American judge, a Muslim Gold Star family—whatever he thinks will work.
Jews aren’t on Trump’s target list. His son-in-law and grandkids are Jewish. His daughter, Ivanka, is a Jewish convert. But Trump’s habit of retweeting alt-right material—Hillary Clinton with a Star of David, for instance—has immersed him in the muck of anti-Semitism. And in the past few days, Trump has turned to an ideology of global conspiracy that resembles the speeches of a certain politician from a century ago.
For Trump, the principal enemy is Muslims. He blames Muslim Americans collectively for domestic terrorism—falsely claiming, for instance, that many of them saw but didn’t report the preparations for last year’s attack in San Bernardino, California—and says we should never have let their parents into the country. For Hitler, the interlopers were Jews. Speaking in Munich on July 28, 1922, he lamented that they had been given German citizenship. Jews “have always formed and will form a state within the state,” said Hitler. That’s uncomfortably close to Trump’s warnings about Sharia in the United States.
Why did Hitler target Jews? In part it was his personal pathology. In part it was the spirit of the times. But in part it was because Hitler focused on a different kind of crime. Trump campaigns against violent crime. He blames it on immigrants, both legal and illegal. Hitler talked more about financial and cultural crime. In his July 1922 address, the German demagogue criticized the rise of “share-capital’ over “the nation’s labor-strength.” Through this process, Hitler charged, “the stock exchange came to control the whole national economy.” He called for an uprising against foreign financial interests: “We shall possess once again a true German Reich of freedom and of honor, a real Fatherland of the whole German people and not an asylum for alien swindlers.”
Hitler returned to these themes in many speeches, complaining that Germany had become a “puppet of alien forces” (September 1923) and that “the state is not a plantation where the interests of foreign capital are supreme” (April 1923). In April 1922, Hitler explained where his analysis pointed:
 If we ask who was responsible for our misfortune, then we must inquire who profited by our collapse. And the answer to that question is that “banks and stock exchanges are more flourishing than ever before.” … It is only the international stock exchange and loan-capital, the so-called supra-state capital, which has profited from the collapse of our economic life, the capital which receives its character from the single supra-state nation which is itself national to the core, which fancies itself to be above all other nations, which places itself above other nations and which already rules over them. The international stock exchange capital would be unthinkable, it would never have come, without its founders: the supra-national, because intensely national, Jews. 
Trump hasn’t said the J-word. Because of his family, I don’t think he ever will. But many of his alt-right followers have. And in the past week, Trump has paved the way for his movement to become more openly anti-Semitic, by aiming his speeches at a worldwide financial conspiracy. He says a “global power structure” has “robbed our working class” and “stripped our country of its wealth.” He says this sinister elite has “dissolved” our borders, flooded our land with immigrants, and “bled our country dry.” At a rally in Florida on Tuesday, Trump charged, “Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.”
Trump’s words echo a warning delivered in Munich in September 1922, when Hitler fumed that the destiny of 60 million Germans had come “to lie at the will of a few dozen Jewish bankers.” Likewise, Trump’s depiction of the “rigged media” as an extension of the global conspiracy follows in the Führer’s footsteps. In July 1922, Hitler asserted:
 In this other Europe, it is not the peoples which agitate against us, but it is the secret power of the organized press which ceaselessly pours new poison into the hearts of these peoples. And who are then these bandits of the press? The brothers and the relatives of the publishers of our own newspapers. And the capital source which provides the energy which here and there drives them forward is the Jewish dream of world supremacy. * 
There’s no evidence that Trump is an anti-Semite. But historically, the arguments he’s making have lent themselves to, and have led to, anti-Semitic movements, policies, and atrocities. And while it’s comforting to point out that our Constitution protects minorities, there’s little evidence that Trump and his followers respect most of that document. Trump has made clear that at a minimum, he’d like to revisit the First, Fourth, Eighth, and 14th Amendments. In speeches this week, he ridiculed the Obama administration for refusing, on constitutional grounds, to revoke the citizenship of newly naturalized immigrants. Trump repeated his insistence that Clinton “should be locked up” despite her having been cleared by an FBI investigation. He said her lawyers should be jailed, too. In fact, Trump added, “She shouldn’t be allowed to run for president.”
Trump isn’t Hitler. But in 1922, Hitler wasn’t Hitler, either. And Hitler was the culmination of a long era of anti-Semitism, fueled by polemics about wealthy foreign elites that met in secret to plot world domination, trample national sovereignty, and suck the blood of the people. Let’s not go down that road again. Let’s not even get close.

a711e6a9,http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/judge-dismisses-sandy-hook-families-lawsuit-against-gun-maker,Judge Dismisses Sandy Hook Lawsuit Against Gunmaker,"A Connecticut judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by the families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting against a gun manufacturer.
On Oct. 14, State Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis granted a motion by Remington Arms, the manufacturer of the Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used in the Sandy Hook shooting, to dismiss the lawsuit brought by the families of nine children and adults who were killed and a teacher who survived the December 14, 2012, attack, Fox News reports.
In the lawsuit, the families argued that Remington Arms should be held accountable for the shooting since the company sold a semi-automatic rifle that, as their lawyers said, is too dangerous for public use because it was designed as a military killing machine.
Judge Bellis decided Remington Arms was not responsible for the attack, agreeing with the company’s lawyers that the case should be dismissed under the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which Congress passed in 2005 to protect gun manufacturers and distributors from liability if their firearms are used in commission of a criminal act.
The families’ attorneys tried to use an exception in the law to argue the case -- negligent entrustment -- where litigation is allowed against companies that know their weapons may pose a risk of injury to others.
Judge Bellis did not agree.
“[The] criminal misuse of a weapon [by Adam Lanza means the action] falls squarely within the broad immunity provided by PLCAA,"" Bellis said, according to CNN.
Lanza, the 20-year-old Sandy Hook shooter, shot and killed 20 children and six adults in the attack. He took his own life as police approached.
The families of the victims are not giving up their fight against Remington Arms.
""While the families are obviously disappointed with the judge's decision, this is not the end of the fight,"" lawyer Joshua Koskoff, who is representing the families, said. ""We will appeal this decision immediately and continue our work to help prevent the next Sandy Hook from happening.""
Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut took to Twitter on Oct. 14 to express his disappointment with the judge’s decision.
“Disappointed by decision to dismiss the lawsuit brought by #SandyHook families,"" he tweeted. ""#PLCAA denies victims of gun violence their day in court.""
Remington Arms did not comment on the dismissal of the lawsuit to CNN, but previously said PLCAA provides it “complete immunity.”

If the first $20 million yielded cheers, the second $15 million generated stunned silence.

Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz vaulted suddenly and without any advance warning to the top rung of Democratic party mega donors with two unheralded tears through his checkbook in the last six weeks. His money significantly altered the short-term financial position of the pro-Hillary Clinton forces and revealed a previously unknown source of cash for Democrats.

In the days after Moskovitz's money landed, the party's leading finance operatives struggled to control their excitement at the prospect of finally having an answer to Republicans’ Sheldon Adelson in the shape of a Silicon Valley titan like the ones Democrats have been chasing after for well over a decade.

“This is a unicorn-type campaign gift — you just don’t see someone basically walk into a campaign without a significant track record of activity and contribute at this level,” said veteran Democratic strategist Chris Lehane, a Clinton White House alum who works closely with top party donors in Silicon Valley.

The deeply private 32-year-old — who is worth $12.7 billion, according to Bloomberg — is a long-time philanthropist but political newcomer. He hasn’t started to build contacts with local operatives. And he hasn’t said a word publicly about his political involvement beyond a pair of Medium posts announcing it in the first place.

So now, grateful but puzzled Democrats in Washington and Silicon Valley are wondering, does Moskovitz’s move herald the dawning of the new age of tech money that they’ve been pursuing? Or is his unparalleled cash infusion a non-replicable, one-off response to Trump?

Campaign cash from the tech industry has long skewed heavily to Democrats, and in recent cycles moguls have developed a practice of pitching in toward the end of the campaign to boost candidates, most notably Barack Obama in 2012. Clinton’s bid has even mobilized a set of tech icons to get more involved than ever before, most prominently Apple CEO Tim Cook and Steve Jobs’ widow Laurene Powell Jobs, a philanthropist and activist, as the era of Democratic resistance to giving massive donations to super PACs wanes.

But the $35 million from Moskovitz — who declined POLITICO’s request to talk about his political involvement — is far more than others have contributed, even though he wrote that such big donations to politics make him uncomfortable. And while top Democrats have developed close relationships with other Northern California luminaries as the community established itself as the party’s top money source, he has rarely been part of that circuit. (One email exchange released by WikiLeaks last week illustrates the dynamic: Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in August 2015 asked Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta if he would consider sitting down with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to discuss philanthropy and public policy, and Podesta agreed to set something up. Moskovitz’s name isn’t in any of the hacked Podesta emails.)

And before this cycle, Moskovitz’s only recorded political donations had been $5,200 to the failed 2014 House bid of Sean Eldridge, the husband of fellow Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, according to Center for Responsive Politics data.

Despite his hesitance to talk on the record about his involvement, Moskovitz's Twitter page has started to look like that of a regular political junky, as he quotes Clinton while re-tweeting poll numbers. (""trumped up trickle down karma,"" he wrote on October 12, noting Clinton's polling lead, shortly before tweeting a picture of Trump with the ""demagorgon"" from the TV show ""Stranger Things"" and calling it ""This season's scariest halloween costume."")

But there was nothing before September that even hinted at the massive and sophisticated donation scheme he would unveil this time around. After announcing in September that he would drop $10 million into a Clinton campaign fund, the Senate and House Democrats’ campaign wings, MoveOn.org, the Color of Change PAC and voter registration and get-out-the-vote groups, plus $5 million each for the League of Conservation Voters and the union-backed For Our Future super PAC, he followed up early this month by pledging $7 million more to registration and mobilization organizations, $3 million to political groups, and $5 million to Priorities USA Action, the main pro-Clinton super PAC.

People familiar with Moskovitz's thinking say he had been inching toward politics after focusing primarily on philanthropy for years. But whether he joins the ranks of Tom Steyer or Haim Saban as top Democratic donors, or even becomes an Eric Schmidt-like ally to party leaders, local and national fundraisers are reluctant to guess.

Democratic operatives on the West Coast say they still haven’t met Moskovitz, haven’t seen him at party or candidate fundraising events, are not aware of whether he has a political representative helping him, and report that his name had never before been on their donation target lists. Multiple top Democrats responded to POLITICO’s questions about Moskovitz by simply replying, ‘Who?” and two admitted to looking up his name and donations on Google before responding to emails about him.

Indeed, they say, all indications are that his foray into politics is entirely driven by Trump, who Moskovitz savaged in his pair of blog posts announcing the donations, rather than a longer-term intention to become a political player.

“The Republican Party, and Donald Trump in particular, is running on a zero-sum vision, stressing a false contest between their constituency and the rest of the world. We believe their positions, especially on immigration, which purport to improve the lives of Americans, would in practice hurt citizens and noncitizens alike. In contrast, the Democratic Party, and Hillary Clinton in particular, is running on a vision of optimism, pragmatism, inclusiveness and mutual benefit,” Moskovitz wrote in September on behalf of himself and his wife Cari Tuna, calling Trump’s promises “quite possibly a deliberate con, an attempt to rally energy and support without the ability to deliver. His proposals are so implausible that the nation is forced to worry that his interest in the presidency might not even extend beyond winning a contest and promoting his personal brand.""

The day after the publication of a tape showing Trump making lewd remarks about a woman surfaced, Moskovitz then piled on his second wave of cash: “Further investments are warranted, particularly in support of work targeting millennial and independent voters. These contributions will go towards voter outreach and engagement efforts focused on those key audiences,” he wrote. “The events of the past few weeks have only deepened my conviction that Hillary is the best choice for America. I hope that these contributions will help make that outcome a reality.""

To fellow tech-world entrepreneurs and northern California Democratic insiders, therefore, the development carries all the hallmarks of a major one-time investment — much to the frustration of party fundraising pros whose search for the next George Soros continues apace, but to the short-term delight of party operatives working to help Clinton zero in on the White House.

“Dustin is acting in the typical Silicon Valley way — be bold, go big, make a difference in the world,” said Steve Spinner, an entrepreneur and top-tier Democratic fundraiser. “Although rarely seen in politics, it’s not surprising at all given the type of person and leader he is.""","moskovitz,donor,polit,democrat parti,democrat,parti,clinton,cofound,monei,silicon"
7e19d10b,http://www.toledoblade.com/Medical/2016/10/24/Sounding-the-alarm-ENTs-warn-diabetes-can-lead-to-hearing-loss.html,Sounding the alarm: ENTs warn diabetes can lead to hearing loss,"It is widely known that part of managing diabetes means keeping tabs on related complications that affect eyesight, the feet, kidneys, blood pressure, and even oral health.
What is commonly missing from that checklist is hearing.
Research shows that those with diabetes are twice as likely to have hearing loss compared to those without the disease. Those diagnosed with prediabetes are also more likely to have audio issues.
Published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2008 and funded by the National Institutes of Health, the study found a link between diabetes and hearing loss. It reported “hearing impairment may be an underrecognized complication of diabetes.”
Though the results have been out for at least eight years, many diabetics are still unaware of this complication, and often don’t know their hearing has deteriorated.
It is usually family members who notice first, as they are told to “speak up” or find their spoken word to someone with hearing loss is returned with “What did you say?”
Issues related to balance may prompt a patient to schedule an appointment with an otolaryngologist or ENT.
“We initially see them because they are having dizzy problems. Then we do a hearing test and find they are losing their hearing as well,” said Dr. Afser Shariff, an ENT at the independent practice ENT Physicians located in Toledo and Oregon.
He has diagnosed hearing loss in people as young as 40.
Dr. Shariff said complications from diabetes erodes the nerves in the inner ear, just as it can chip away at other organs and appendages.
Diabetics can suffer from diabetic neuropathy, long-term damage to nervous structures, traditionally related to pain in the legs or pain in the arms. Diabetic retinopathy, long-term nerve damage to the retina, is a leading cause of blindness, he said.
“If you think of diabetes in the neuropathic sense, yes, then you are definitely going to have hearing loss as a growing component of diabetes. Especially since more and more people have diabetes and they live longer than they ever used to,” he said.
Experts advise those living with diabetes to take a comprehensive approach to leading a healthy lifestyle, as ailments like high blood pressure affect nerve damage.
“It also damages a portion of the brain, the periventricular white matter, where you have the microvessels. Patients who have diabetes and high blood pressure tend to have a higher rate of damage to a central part of their brain from long-standing diabetes and high blood pressure,” Dr. Shariff said.
That central brain is responsible for processing the sensations from your feet, ears, and eyes. In turn all three of those body systems form a “compensatory mechanism” responsible for our sense of balance.
Dr. Shariff explained it as a highway system, with cars coming from three different starting points, traveling to reach the city center. If the road is clear, all three reach the destination and are processed on time. However, with diabetes, imagine that road covered in potholes and construction, delaying the cars or messages.
“The message gets there at different times and the brain gets a little confused cause ‘Wait a minute, what is going on here? My feet are saying one thing, my eyes are saying another. Even though they are saying the same thing, they are arriving at different times and I don’t know what to make of it,’ ” he said.
So even with a hearing aid, it may take someone a while to comprehend what is said. 
Prevention
If you have hearing loss, don’t wait to get a hearing aid. Treating adult hearing loss at the early stages reduces the risk of dementia, Dr. Shariff said.
Alison Johnson, an audiologist at ProMedica Flower Hospital Hearing Center, said that diabetics along with family doctors are so zeroed in on the other neuropathy side effects related to eyes and appendages, that checking hearing is often overlooked. Another factor is people believe hearing loss is a normal part of aging.
“Really it is not. It is really wear and tear and some people have more of that than others. That is why it is linked to aging, sometimes,” she said.
She said diabetics and prediabetics should be proactive in getting a baseline hearing test. The test establishes your normal hearing and audiologists can compare it to succeeding tests, indicating if there has been a change over time.
Anyone with noise exposure or who suffers from an ailment that affects the ears should follow up with annual tests.
“People always ask, ‘Well, how fast will my hearing change?’ Well if I don’t have anything to compare it to, I don’t know,” she said.
Typically the person with hearing loss is not the first one to notice the problem because it happens so gradually, she said. Tinnitus, a ringing in the ear, can be an early symptom.
A patient with hearing aids still needs an annual hearing check, so the devices can be programmed accordingly.
Managing diabetes
Diabetics in poor health are more susceptible to nerve damage caused by the elevated blood sugar levels.
“This is another reason why we want you to manage your blood sugars and be in good control,” said Jeannie Wagner, registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator at Mercy Health St. Vincent Hospital.
A balanced diet and exercising routinely helps to minimize the aggravating factors, such as uncontrolled lipids or uncontrolled blood pressure.
Sugar circulating in the bloodstream stays within the blood vessels themselves, depositing and causing damage, she said. Physical activity helps move sugar out of the bloodstream and into the cells.
Avoid foods that have excess sugar. Eat more complex carbohydrates and fiber and be mindful of fat content.
Dr. Shariff said that diabetics will still have some damage, but diet and exercise are integral to limiting the damage.
“Exercise is critical,” he said. “It is what keeps nerves healthy. It helps to strengthen the blood flow. Most of the damage is a combination of nerve damage and vascular damage from inadequate blood flow.”
He recommended incorporating low-impact fitness into your health routine, such as tai chi, yoga, or Pilates. Those three exercises have been found to be beneficial. They are also kind on the joints and help maintain balance through your 80s and 90s, he said.

7a2fb5c5,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/briefing/election-internet-nsa.html,"Election, Internet, N.S.A.: Your Friday Evening Briefing","Good evening. Here’s the latest.

1. Could Donald Trump actually challenge the results on Nov. 8?

Well, he could try.

But the electoral process differs from state to state, and it would be a mammoth and expensive undertaking to attempt in more than one.

Mr. Trump campaigned in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, and Hillary Clinton encouraged early voters in Ohio. Above, a Nascar truck in Talladega, Ala.

In case you missed it, Mr. Trump was booed as both candidates delivered roasts at a white-tie charity dinner in Manhattan on Thursday night. Here are the video highlights.

2. It’s not just you— the internet had major problems today.

Major websites were inaccessible to people across wide swaths of the United States on Friday after a company that manages crucial parts of the internet’s infrastructure said it was under attack. The map above shows the affected areas.

Twitter, Netflix, Spotify, Reddit, Etsy, SoundCloud and The New York Times were among those that reported problems.

3. Russia deployed its only aircraft carrier to Syria. The aging Admiral Kuznetsov made its way through the English Channel, above, carrying 15 warplanes and leading seven other vessels.

Russia is backing President Bashar al-Assad as he seeks to regain total control of the divided city of Aleppo.

The top human rights official at the U.N. said the siege and bombardment of rebel-held Aleppo had turned it into a “slaughterhouse.”

4. AT&T is in talks to acquire Time Warner, according to three people briefed on the discussions.

The deal could be the largest in the U.S. this year.

Time Warner’s shares were up 8 percent, while AT&T shares were down nearly 3 percent.

Luke Sharrett for The New York Times

5. A new study of gun violence in the U.S. shows how porous gun laws are and how difficult tightening them may be.

We examined all 130 shootings last year in which four or more people were shot, at least one fatally, and investigators identified at least one attacker.

More than half involved an attacker who violated an existing gun law.

Makyleigh Anderson, above, was shot by a man who bought his gun legally. Her parents and brother were killed.

6. The Islamic State attacked the Iraqi city of Kirkuk, diverting attention away from the fight to take back Mosul.

Gun battles in the heart of the Kurdish-controlled city lasted for hours and were broadcast live on local television.

Noah Berger for The New York Times

7. Wells Fargo’s scandal over sham bank accounts isn’t going away.

Former employees are describing tactics used when they targeted customers for unauthorized or unnecessary accounts.

Nate Pesce for The New York Times

8. Prosecutors say a former N.S.A. contractor arrested in August stole top-secret plans for an operation against a hostile country.

Prosecutors plan to charge Harold Martin III, a 51-year-old veteran, with espionage and other felonies. There has been no evidence so far that he gave anyone else the documents.

They say Mr. Martin also kept an “arsenal” of firearms in his Maryland home, above.

9. Is “Moonlight” the year’s best movie?

Our critic says the film, above, about growing up poor, black and gay, is both disarmingly personal and an urgent social document.

We also reviewed the new season of “Black Mirror” on Netflix, and Fox’s remake of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” starring Laverne Cox.



10. You’ve just landed in a foreign country. What’s the polite way to greet the people you meet? A bow, a handshake, a hug or a kiss? (And then, how many?)

The world may be increasingly globalized, but when it comes to greeting practices, local customs still prevail — and things can get awkward.

In northern Europe, a handshake will suffice, but make that a quadruple air-kiss in Nantes, France, and in Tibet, stick out your tongue.

Hackers went after a host of domain name servers on Friday, which likely explains why many people are experiencing problems with web services such as Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, Airbnb and Spotify.
Dyn, the DNS host that fell victim to the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, announced on its website Friday morning that people ― mostly in the U.S., according to a heat map ― would have ongoing problems trying to visit certain sites.
“Starting at 11:10 UTC on October 21th-Friday 2016 we began monitoring and mitigating a DDoS attack against our Dyn Managed DNS infrastructure,” the post reads. “Some customers may experience increased DNS query latency and delayed zone propagation during this time. Updates will be posted as information becomes available.”
Dyn reported around 9:45 a.m. Eastern that service had been restored, but later acknowledged that the initial problem hadn’t been fixed and announced that it had fallen victim to two more DDoS attacks that also affected users on the West Coast and in Europe. The Department of Homeland Security has reportedly been made aware of the attack and is investigating “all potential causes.”
Our advanced service monitoring issue is currently resolved. We are still investigating and mitigating the attacks on our infrastructure.
— Dyn (@Dyn) October 21, 2016
Anonymous and New World Friday, two hacktivist groups, claimed responsibility for the attack on Friday, according to Politico. The groups claimed the assault was in retaliation for the shutdown of WikiLeaks founder Julia Assange’s internet access in Ecuador. Security experts told Politico, however, that the true culprit has yet to be confirmed.
Meanwhile, users across the East Coast have reported that access to a bevy of popular sites has been limited throughout the day. Gizmodo added dozens of sites and services to its list of outages, including media outlets like SBNation, Vox and CNN, as well as online video games and even delivery sites like GrubHub.
Gizmodo, which first made the connection between the attack and widespread outages, explains the situation:
Domain Name Servers (DNS) act as the Internet’s phone book. Basically, they facilitate your request to go to a certain webpage and make sure you are taken to the right place. If the DNS provider that handles requests for Twitter is down, well, good luck getting to Twitter. Some websites are coming back for some users, but it doesn’t look like the problem is fully resolved.
There is no indication that this type of attack puts any consumer information at risk.
Heat maps show sweeping outages across the Eastern seaboard. This one is from about 9:15 a.m. Eastern time:

Dyn did not immediately return a request for comment.

Snakes are showing up in herds in north Texas due to an increase in rodents.
The Wichita Falls Times Record News reports animal control collected four rattlesnakes over the weekend and several pets have been attacked. City health department workers told the newspaper they believe rat and mice populations increased because of excess rainfall and increased crop yields. 
As such, the city of Wichita Falls has warned residents to be on the lookout for snakes, including rattlesnakes.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration reports about 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the U.S. each year, killing 10 to 15 people annually. Rattlesnakes are generally not aggressive and do not prey on humans. The majority of snake bites occur on the hands, feet and ankles. 
Despite the increased amount of snakes in Wichita Falls and other parts of Texas, the Food and Drug Administration notes snakes are one of the only animals in the country that help control the U.S. rodent population.

It's hard to decide which is better between Nicki Minaj's flawless looks or her hard-hitting lyrics. Either way, it's safe to say that you can't go wrong picking one over the other. Nicki earned her stripes in the late 2000s for her rugged, sex-laden lyrics until she evolved into a mainstream goddess after her debut album Pink Friday.

Besides holding the torch as the leading lady in rap, she's arguably one of the hottest women in the industry, period. Though Meek Mill gets constantly dragged by the media for his antics, he never pays any mind to the negativity because he knows that at the end of the day, his dream lady, Nicki, right beside him.

Photo: U.S. Air Force
U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Paul T. “PJ” Johnson is right up there with the best pilots to have ever flown the A-10. While serving as a captain during Operation Desert Storm, he was decorated with the Air Force Cross for leading the rescue mission of a downed Navy F-14 Tomcat pilot deep behind enemy lines.
Capt. Johnson was en route from another mission when he received the call to search for the F-14 crew that had been shot down the night before. During the next six hours, he lead the search through three aerial refuelings, one attack on a possible SCUD missile site, and three hours of going deeper into enemy territory than any A-10 had ever flown. When he finally spotted the survivor, an enemy vehicle was heading in his direction, which Johnson proceeded to destroy, thus securing the target.
The mission was successful and a first for the A-10. A few days later, Johnson’s skills were on full display when he was hit by an enemy missile while trying to take out a radar site. The explosion left a gaping hole on his right wing, which disabled one of the hydraulic systems. Still, he managed to fly back to safety.
This video shows how Johnson pulled through his “high pucker factor” experience, which he credits to a “wing and a prayer.”
Watch:
Gen. Johnson received his commission in 1985 from Officer Training School, Lackland Air Force Base. He’s a command pilot with more than 3,000 hours on the A-10 and served as commander of the 75th Fighter Squadron, Pope AFB, N.C.; the 354th Operations Group, Eielson AFB, Alaska; the 355th Fighter Wing, Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona; and 451st Air Expeditionary Wing, Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan. He’s retiring on July 01, 2016, according to his Air Force profile.

Is your guy acting shady?
Discovering that your partner has cheated on you is terrible, but learning that they've been having an ongoing affair is the worst. You can almost accept a momentary lapse in judgment, but when a person has repeatedly cheated on you, for months or even years, you feel destroyed.
The worst part is, if you don't catch your partner in the act, you either have to confront them right away or you have slowly build evidence to confirm your suspicions. How do you act with someone you suspect of cheating on you?
Many times, men who are having an affair get very good at hiding it, and when confronted about it they have the ability to convince their partner that the infidelity they were imagining simply didn't happen.
When the person you love is having an affair, you start to question everything they said or did in your own relationship. You wonder if, in the end, it's your fault that your partner strayed as if there was something you could have done or if there were signs that you missed.
No matter how skillful someone is at hiding an affair, they still will slip up. Often times, it's a question of paying attention to their behavior and reading between the lines of what they say.
Astrology teaches us so much about human behavior that it's not surprising that the zodiac sign you're born under affects the way you act when you're having an affair. A Leo having an affair isn't going to behave the same way a Scorpio does. Astrology can also guide us on which of the signs is more likely to cheat, and which aren't.
You should never take these guides as life advice. Some actions that a cheater might do are actions that any of us might do, so it's important not to make any major decisions based on this information or to jump to conclusions.
Here's how he acts when he's having an affair, according to his zodiac sign.

2fca430b,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/evan-bayh-indiana-senate-todd-young-230196,The collapse of Evan Bayh,"Evan Bayh acknowledges that his initial eye-popping advantage over Todd Young was based mostly on name recognition. | AP Photo
INDIANAPOLIS — When Evan Bayh launched a startling comeback bid for his Indiana Senate seat this summer, Republicans vowed to make his return to politics miserable.
They weren’t kidding.
In the three months since he got in, Bayh’s opponents have unleashed a torrent of attacks on the former senator: For reports that he rarely set foot in Indiana until he decided he wanted back in the Senate, for backing unpopular Obama policies, and for trading on his political connections to become really rich after he left office. Bayh's once-commanding lead over Republican Todd Young has nearly evaporated. National Democrats have had to shell out more cash to rescue Bayh, whose $10 million war chest left over from his Senate days was a big part of his appeal as a recruit in the first place.
The Bayh name, which goes back six decades in Indiana politics, is under barrage – and this critical Senate battleground state will turn on whether Republicans can drive down his numbers even further in the next two weeks to stage what would be one of the biggest upsets of 2016.
Has Bayh hit his floor? No one’s really sure.
“They’ve drawn the line and said, ‘You’ve had your chance, you basically left us, you’re not representing our values, you’ve doubled the national debt, Obamacare is a mess and collapsing,” retiring Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), whose seat Bayh and Young are fighting to fill, said of Indiana voters in an interview here. “They don’t want somebody who was part of that establishment to come back and say, ‘I’m the change person.”
But for now, Democrats here feel they’ve staunched the bleeding.
“I do feel good that we’ve seen some stabilization over the past few weeks,” said Mark Fraley, the Democratic Party chairman in Monroe County, about an hour south of Indianapolis. “We expected there to be some tightening. He wasn’t always going to have a 25-point lead.”
Bayh, who's never lost a race in 30 years in politics, acknowledges that his initial eye-popping advantage over Young was based mostly on name recognition. But he says that in his previous competitive races, for secretary of state in 1986 and then governor in 1988, he won only by single digits. He dismisses any notion that he is losing appeal with Indiana voters, whom he last faced on the ballot in 2004.
A six-point win ""would be right in the wheelhouse of what I’ve normally done when there’s a lot of money being spent on both sides and a vigorously contested campaign,” a confident Bayh said in an interview with POLITICO after greeting volunteers at the Vanderburgh County Democratic headquarters in Evansville. “Any time you have $20 million of negative attacks spent on you, frankly, I’m kind of happy we’re still ahead.”
The former senator is still greeted warmly as he campaigns around the state, a testament to the fond memories voters have of him and his father, former Sen. Birch Bayh. At King Ribs, a barbecue joint in Indianapolis, Bayh approaches two women to introduce himself, but one beats him to the punch: “Mr. Bayh, we know exactly who you are!”
But his 20-plus point lead is down to six points, according to the two most recent independent polls of the race. Shortly before those surveys, Young's campaign announced his internal polling had him up a single point. Multiple Democratic operatives say their own internal polling finds Bayh still leading outside the margin of error.
However close it is, Republicans say the momentum is with Young, a hard-charging former Marine Corps officer who jumps at any chance to contrast his own background with the scion of Indiana politics.
“My dad is a small businessman, my mom is a registered nurse,” Young said while touring a start-up business hub in Terre Haute during a campaign swing last week with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). “I’m proud of my dad’s name. But I’m not running on my dad’s name. I’m running on my dad’s values.”
Young strategy has been clear all along: turn Bayh's last name, and the notion that he's relying solely on it to win, into a liability. And couple that with the case that Bayh left Indiana to profit from public service after voting on controversial policies such as President Barack Obama’s signature health care law.
Indeed, recently filed personal financial disclosure forms show Bayh has been compensated handsomely in his post-Senate life. He banked nearly $6.3 million since January 2015 in salary, board compensation and speaking fees, according to those disclosures. Bayh and his wife, Susan, now report $13.9 million to $48 million in assets, compared to $2.1 and $7.7 million when Bayh left the Senate at the end of 2010.
Bayh doesn’t talk at length when asked to respond to charges that he profited from his time in the Senate.
“I’ve been proud to work with some good Indiana businesses, like Berry Plastics right here in Evansville, largest employer in town, to grow that company, to create jobs,” Bayh said in the interview, referring to one company that paid him $400,000 since January 2015 to sit on its board. “I’m proud of that.”
Bayh’s freefall in the polls and all the negative ads against him have unnerved even some of his most fervent supporters.
Evelyn LaFollette, a 75-year-old Democrat from Bloomington, said she’s “unsure” whether the reservoir of Bayh family goodwill would be enough to counter the sustained attacks against him.
“He did leave his seat in the Senate,” acknowledged LaFollette, who was wearing a blue “Bayh” sticker as she volunteered at a Democratic call center in Bloomington. “My own husband — my own dear Republican husband — said that he would have voted for Evan, but now he’s unsure because of the way he left his former position in the Senate.”
Bayh’s commanding advantage early on didn't deter conservative outside groups from swarming Indiana. Independent expenditures in the race as of Sunday total more than $29.9 million so far, records show, with $16.1 million spent attacking Bayh compared to $10.1 million spent against Young, a three-term House Republican, in the general election.
Americans for Prosperity, part of the sprawling network of groups funded by the Koch brothers, has spent $1.8 million hitting Bayh so far. The Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC with close ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), had reserved nearly $9 million on air in Indiana, a relatively cheap state in which to advertise, but just added $1.75 million more for the week of Nov. 1.
Young and his allies have latched onto a recent Associated Press report that found Bayh had more than four dozen meetings and phone calls concerning his future employment prospects after he announced his retirement from the Senate in February 2010 until his term ended. The Indianapolis Star subsequently noted that the Bayh campaign initially said Bayh did not meet with officials from Apollo Global Management, the private equity firm that has employed him since January 2011 — though the AP story revealed otherwise.
Another damaging AP report last week found that Bayh spent $3,000 of taxpayer money for trips to New York that included meetings with top banking officials and one job headhunter. Bayh denied using public dollars for personal use. But the AP stood by its report, which came out the same day Young earned the endorsement of the Star, the state's largest newspaper.
“You take the combination of his actual voting record, his post-Senate focus and these more recent revelations about hunting for jobs at taxpayer expense,” said Steven Law, a former McConnell chief of staff who leads the Senate Leadership Fund. “All of that has smashed the Evan Bayh image that I think he tried to project at the beginning of this election.”
Bayh is certainly not struggling for campaign money; the Democrat has more than $5 million cash on hand. But Young outraised Bayh in the quarter that ended Sept. 30.
And how much the residency issue will ultimately matter is an open question; a Ball State University poll, which had Bayh leading Young by 6 points, found 22 percent of voters said they are less likely to support Bayh because of it, but 71 percent said it won’t change their mind.
But for some Indiana voters, it did matter.
“If you’re a lifelong resident here and you’ve got a congressman or senator that maybe has a residence here but they don’t spend any time here,"" said Randy Ballinger, a 65-year-old Republican from Marion, Ind., who said he plans to vote for Young, ""they don’t understand what’s going on here.""

Evidence seems to suggest the mounting pressure on Ecuador is having a profound effect and the results may end with Assange in the hands of the U.S. or other powers looking to silence his ability to expose corruption around the globe.
In one of its latest tweets WikiLeaks says there are heavily armed forces outside of the Ecuadorian Embassy, the facility where Assange has been allowed refuge as global powers close in around him. The tweet has not yet been confirmed and thanks to a massive suspicious DOS attack that is causing internet problems around the U.S. Twitter cannot currently be accessed.
The tweet comes just days after Ecuador admitted it had indeed cut off internet access Assange was using to direct WikiLeaks activities. And an official claims Ecuador cut off the internet access out of fear of what Hillary Clinton could do to their nation if she’s elected President come November.
More from Breitbart.
A former ambassador for the government of Ecuador told the Agence France-Presse that his country may have cut off internet access to Wikileaks’s Julian Assange because they fear revenge from a potential Hillary Clinton presidency.
Speaking to AFP, former Ecuadorian ambassador to London Mauricio Gandara said that “of course” his former boss President Rafael Correa “is uncomfortable” about the fact that Assange, who lives in the Ecuadorian embassy of London as a political refugee, is posting the hacked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta online. “The government is scared because it understands Clinton is probably going to win and could make them pay,” he argued. Correa has stated in the past that he would vote for Clinton over her rival Donald Trump if he were a U.S. citizen.
Is Ecuador about to allow Assange to be apprehended? Only time will tell. And with limited ability to get information we’re currently in the dark.
We do know, however, that Ecuador caved to pressure after Assange leaked Clinton related emails and WikiLeaks now says there are armed forces outside of the embassy.
Lots of questions and few answers. We’ll provide updates when more answers are known.

Sounds easy (and it is), but there are some things you can do to make it great. Like invest in a good thermometer. Roast chicken can become dry in a hurry if it’s overcooked. Temp your bird in the thickest part of the thigh until it reaches 165 degrees F. It will be thoroughly cooked, but still moist and juicy. And if you’re like me and the million others who plan on eating healthier in the new year, the skin on the roast chicken is off limits. But you won’t miss it if you remember to season your bird with salt and pepper under the skin. This way the seasoning makes direct contact with the meat so you’ll get more flavor.

Everyone loves a juicy burger. But the classic juicy burger you probably had at your last barbecue was compliments of some not-so-lean beef. In the EatingWell Test Kitchen, we like to use 90%–lean ground beef or leaner. Good for the heart, but not so good for the juicy factor—lean beef can get incredibly dry. So I’m going to get creative about making healthier burgers by adding chopped vegetables and other things like barbecue sauce to the meat to boost flavor and moisture, and I’ll be careful not to overwork the meat while I’m mixing it up so it doesn’t become too tough.

What to Know
A 15-year-old girl was brutally beaten and sexually assaulted by a man she met at a Bronx subway station Monday morning
Police say the victim and the suspect walked to Bronx Park together and the man attacked
The NYPD released surveillance video of the suspect on Tuesday morning; they said he is about 25 years old
Police are searching for a man in newly released surveillance video who they say brutally beat and sexually assaulted a teenage girl in a Bronx park. 
The new video shows the suspect — described by police as a 25-year-old man with scabs on his lips — running quickly down Bronx Boulevard following the attack early Monday morning, police said. 
Police got a call on Monday morning about a girl at Montefiore Hospital who had been severely beaten near the Gun Hill Road subway station in the borough’s Olinville neighborhood.
Police said the girl met a man at the station after getting off a northbound 2 train. The two of them walked together to Bronx Park, near the corner of Bronx Boulevard and East 213 Street. 
At about 4 a.m., the man attacked her. He beat and kicked her in the head several times before sexually assaulting her, police said. He then ran off. 
The girl was unconscious after the attack, but came to at about 6 a.m. A good Samaritan helped her and brought her to the hospital. 
Police said the teen has bruising to her head, missing teeth, and a broken pelvis. 
Detectives were still in the park gathering evidence on Monday night. Residents living in the area said they were sickened and on edge after learning of the attacks.

MAITLAND, Fla. - A 32-year-old woman was arrested Saturday on DUI charges after she drove the wrong way on Interstate 4 in Maitland and crashed into a barrier, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. 
FHP said in an arrest report that it received about 13 calls to 911 about the driver, who was going west on I-4 East.
Troopers said when they approached the crashed car, Angela Sammons got out of the sedan without shoes, and that when a trooper handed Sammons her shoes she put them on the wrong feet. 
The FHP report stated Sammons was stumbling and staggering on her feet.
Sammons was placed in the back of a patrol car, where she fell asleep, troopers said.
FHP said when a trooper woke Sammons up and asked her if she was OK, she slurred her words and said she was tired and wanted to go home.
Troopers said they found multiple Florida driver’s licenses in her purse, and loaded guns and handcuffs in her car. 
Sammons was booked into the Orange County Jail on charges of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, involving a vehicle crash, FHP said.
Her bail was set at $500.

If it wasn't clear before Wednesday night's debate, it should be obvious now that Donald Trump is no longer running for president. He is using his campaign to become the leader of what he calls ""our movement"" -- a white supremacist, nativist, and nationalist crusade -- to boost his ego, settle scores (including with many Republicans), and make it impossible for Hillary Clinton to govern. He intends to become America's first celebrity demagogue.
For at least the past month, Trump had realized that he is going to lose the race for president on November 8. Indeed, every day, it looks more and more likely that Clinton will beat him by landslide margins in both the popular vote and the Electoral College.
If he were still running for president, and trying to win 270 Electoral College votes, Trump would be appealing to swing voters in battleground states. But during his performances in all three debates -- as well as in his speeches at Trump rallies since the GOP convention -- he has appealed entirely to his base of fervent supporters. In the third debate, he doubled down on his most extremist positions -- on abortion and immigration, in particular. By inviting President Obama's Kenyan-born half-brother to attend the event, he was signaling his supporters that he still believes in the racist ""birther"" myth that Obama was not born in the United States and is not a legitimate president. 
As his poll numbers have plummeted, Trump has become increasingly inflammatory. After his campaign advisers realized that they could not control him and that he could not control himself -- that he was prone to impulsive and self-destructive behavior -- they tried to turn his worst character traits into an asset by claiming that they were encouraging ""Trump to be Trump."" It was all on display on the podium at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. Trump's performance offered no surprises. What Americans saw was the same racist, sexist, thin-skinned, nativist bully -- filled with paranoid conspiracy theories, unable to make a coherent argument, who went ballistic when Clinton criticized him -- that we've watched for more than a year on the campaign trail. 
For the past few months, Trump has been using his campaign to set the stage for a new white supremacist right-wing media empire with Breitbart News head Stephen Bannon (his campaign chair) and adviser Roger Ailes (the former Fox News head fired for flagrant sexual assault and harassment). Their goal is to create a media vehicle that will serve as the voice of the right-wing movement Trump intends to lead and to compete with, and outfox, Fox News.
What we witnessed Wednesday night was not a presidential debate but a dress rehearsal for the battle between Trump's right-wing movement and the Clinton administration that will begin on November 9 when Trump refuses to acknowledge Clinton's victory but continues to claim -- as he said at the debate -- that the election was ""rigged"" against him. Trump's unprecedented refusal to say that he'd accept the results of the election was the clearest indication that his campaign will morph into an anti-Clinton crusade even before she takes the oath of office in January.
Throughout his campaign, Trump's comments have ""normalized"" many forms of extremist bigotry, including anti-Semitism, hostility to immigrants and Muslims, attacks on Mexicans and African Americans, insults toward women, slanders against veterans like Senator John McCain, and mocking people with disabilities. He has poisoned the culture by encouraging hate and division. He has encourage his fervent follows to engage in violence and to threaten and intimidate voters on election day.
Trump did not invent this ugly aspect of American society but he has given voice to, galvanized, emboldened and mobilized it. 
When the election is over, he will seek to reconstruct the remnants of his campaign, which he has increasingly referred to as ""our movement,"" into a political force that will make the Tea Party and Fox News look tame, boosted by the media savvy of Ailes and Bannon and financial support from right-wing billionaires like hedge fund operator Robert Mercer. Whether they can motivate and mobilize Trump's hard core supporters into an effective political movement is an open question. But surely they will utilize their new media empire to provide Trump with a public stage on which to act out his ego-driven fantasies. He will seek to settle scores with his many enemies, including Republicans who refused to support him, withdrew their support for him, or (like Paul Ryan) failed to fall on their swords for him.
But his biggest target will be Hillary Clinton, whose administration's initiatives he will try to thwart at every turn. He will be a thorn and a tormentor, hoping to put her on the defensive and to rally Clinton haters to pressure Congress to kill her legislative priorities, including raising the minimum wage, expanding Obamacare, and jump-starting jobs with a public infrastructure program, and impeding her efforts to appoint justices to the Supreme Court.
The closest precedent to what Trump hopes to become is Charles Coughlin, the Michigan-based Roman Catholic ""radio priest"" who was the one of first political leaders to use radio to reach a nationwide mass audience. During the Great Depression, Coughlin exploited people's fears and anxieties to advance an anti-Semitic, nativist, isolationist right-wing agenda and his fervent opposition to President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. He used his radio program to promote anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and to support Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. At the peak of his influence, 30 million listeners tuned in to his weekly broadcasts. 
Coughlin was a dangerous force in America for almost a decade. In 1934 he started a political organization called the National Union for Social Justice and a newspaper called Social Justice to mobilize his followers in elections. But the NUSJ was poorly-organized on the local level and he was unable to translate his media appeal into an effective grassroots organization. By 1939 he was forced off the air.
Like Coughlin, Trump has brilliantly used the mainstream media to gain attention and stoke the fears and anxieties of millions of Americans. His greatest talent is that of a self-promoting publicist, marketing his celebrity TV shows, his hotels and apartments, his beauty pageants, his steaks and clothing lines, and, of course, himself. His campaign rallies have been remarkable spectacles filled with zealous true believers. 
Surely, after the election, some of Trump's most fervent admirers - many of them already part of white supremacist hate groups, immigrant-bashing militias, anti-abortion zealots, and gun rights fanatics - will join forces with Trump to stoke hatred and dissension on-line and at rowdy rallies. 
But, also like Coughlin, Trump has shown no talent to building a grassroots political operation. Under his three different campaign managers -- Corey Lewandowski, Paul Manafort, and Kellyanne Conway -- Trump showed no inclination or capacity for developing the ground operation -- voter registration efforts, local precinct organizations, and a get-out-the-vote apparatus -- that is essential to any successful political campaign. So perhaps, like Father Coughlin, Trump's next incarnation will be more that of a controversial right-wing carnival barker than a real movement leader that can mobilize his followers to protest, disrupt and vote. 
Of course, when the election is over, Trump will have other matters to worry about. He will have to spend time in court, before Judge Gonzalo Curiel, defending his phony Trump University con operation. He may have to defend him against lawsuits brought by women whom he sexually assaulted. He will have to pay attention to his troubled real estate empire, golf courses, and casinos that are deeply in debt, and perhaps even face boycotts of his businesses by consumers and former corporate partners. Surely he will hand over many of those tasks to his lawyers and his children, so he can devote time to his next career as the leader of a right-wing movement.
Whether Trump can translate his megalomaniac fantasy into political reality remains to be seen. But as America hits the home stretch of this bizarre election season, it is clear that after the votes have been counted, we won't have seen the last of Donald Trump.

That’s what fans can’t help but wonder as George had a hard time hiding his disdain for his wife and her strange outfit when the couple was spotted in the Big Apple this week.
George and Amal were spotted walking their dog while they were out and about in New York City this week. Amal wore a bizarre, 1970s-inspired outfit with embroidered bell-bottom jeans that made head turns at every corner. George was visibly embarrassed by his wife’s strange choice in style as he kept his head down during a phone call in front of the paparazzi. Surely, Amal could have worn something less eye-catching in public, especially since George makes such an effort to keep a low profile wherever he goes.
It’s without a doubt that George Clooney has every reason to hide his head in shame. Since marrying his wife Amal Alamuddin, she’s done nothing more than show the world just how fame-hungry and desperate for attention she really is. In fact, before she married George, no one even knew who she is and now she’s become an international celebrity lawyer.
Yet, instead of focusing on her cases, she’s more concerned about how she looks in front of the paparazzi or how she can once again make headlines on the red carpet. Amal might want people to believe that she’s not interested in the Hollywood lifestyle, but in reality she’s absolutely obsessed with it. Amal Alamuddin wants to be a style icon more than she wants to win cases in the courtroom.
So does this mean that Amal’s constant need for attention is causing a rift between her and George? Has the actor finally realized that he’s embarrassing them as a couple? Should George be ashamed of his wife? Sure, George loves to play the ‘happy wife, happy life,’ card to the media, but know how fast he grows tired of his girlfriend’s attention-seeking games, it wouldn’t be surprising if he ended up pulling the plug on Amal the same way he’s done it with his ex-girlfriends in the past, too.

This is for you,” said the Trump Organization representative, handing the Fox News host a letter from Trump’s lawyer Marc Kasowitz, which threatened legal action over “reckless, slanderous, and defamatory statements made by Chris Wallace at the presidential debate on October 19, 2016,” and stated that “the timing of these statements moments ago during a nationally televised broadcast makes it clear that this is a politically motivated attempt to harm Mr. Trump’s candidacy.” “If you fail to comply with this order, Mr. Wallace, we’ll have no choice but to sue. Good day.” The Trump Organization official reportedly rushed back onstage moments later after Wallace asked the GOP nominee how much federal income tax he has paid over the past 20 years, serving the moderator a restraining order that barred him from having any contact with Trump for the remainder of the debate.

Police have charged a man with murder after the discovery of a burnt body
The body, with no limbs or head, was found in a burnt suitcase in a lay-by near a Peak district village
It was found on October 10, and it is believed the limbs and head have still not been found
Police launched a nationwide hunt for information as they tried to work out who the man was
It has since transpired police believe they know who the man is but have no told his family yet
Ming Jiang, 42, of Falconwood Way in Manchester, was charged on Sunday afternoon
A Manchester man has since been charged following the finding of the body near Tintwistle.
Ming Jiang, 42, of Falconwood Way, was charged yesterday afternoon, and will appear before magistrates at Chesterfield Justice Centre today.
The shocking discovery of the body on October 10 led to a nation-wide hunt for information.
The man’s limbs and head are believed to still not have been found.
It is understood the police have identified the dead man, after DNA samples taken from the body were tested, but they are not in a position to release the identity.
This is likely to be due to the fact that his next of kin have not been located.
But information released by the police so far have said he is white and between 18-40.
A Derbyshire Constabulary spokesman said: “A Manchester man has been charged with murder following the discovery of a body near Tintwistle on Monday October 10, 2016.
He is due to appear before magistrates at Chesterfield Justice Centre today
The body was discovered with no head or limbs in a lay-by near Woodhead Pass just east of Tintwistle village
It is understood officers do now know who the victim is based on DNA samples taken from the remains of the body
Information released by the police so far have said the alleged victim is white and between 18-40
Although the police think they know who the dead man is, they are unable to say if he was from the Manchester area
“Ming Jiang (42), of Falconwood Way in Manchester, was charged this afternoon (Sunday, October 23) and is due to appear before magistrates at Chesterfield Justice Centre tomorrow.
“The name of the alleged murder victim will not be released until his family is informed of his death.”

Update #1: WikiLeaks has issued a statement. Much of the statement speaks of Wikileaks operations and Ecuadorian policy in regards to WikiLeaks. Still, the public is pleading with the operator of the Wikileaks Twitter account to provide undeniable and irrefutable evidence that Julian Assange is alive and well.

Update #2: WikiLeaks has released a poll asking what kind of “proof of life” the public would like. Currently, the votes are tied between an Assange video and an appearance at the window of the Ecuadorian Embassy. Many think an appearance at the window is too dangerous. However, others are suggesting a simple photo of Assange with a current newspaper.
Thousands keep demanding Assange proof of life. Not unreasonable. He's in a tough spot and is WikiLeaks best known validator. Preference?
— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 24, 2016
Meanwhile, YouTube has been flooded with old videos of Assange dancing in a nightclub and a 2012 video of Assange giving a speech outside of the Ecuadorian Embassy. WikiLeaks, an online document leaking website, has received hundreds of inquiries by the hour on Twitter regarding Assange.
How Can We Put The “Julian Assange Is Dead” Rumors To Rest?
If Julian Assange was alive, he would put the rumors about his alleged torture and death to rest by now, social media users claim. Thousands are assuming Assange has been compromised in some way or has been apprehended by the authorities.
The WikiLeaks Twitter account did not say “Julian Assange” is safe, they said, “We will issue a statement tomorrow about Assange…”
The statement continues on to say, “Our editor is safe and still in full command.”
Many were uncomfortable with the use of the word “Assange,” instead of “Julian.” Also, the use of the word “editor” confused many, as Julian is the founder of WikiLeaks.
Julian Assange’s safety is of much concern. Those concerned with Assange’s safety are beginning to panic, especially since WikiLeaks (instead of addressing Assange) posted more info about the new batch of leaked Podesta emails and Gavin MacFadyen’s movie credits.

Verifiable Proof Julian Assange Is Alive:
This proof of life can come in many forms, hundreds of suggestions have been made as to what will reassure the public of Assange’s safety and well-being. The hashtags #ShowUsJulian, #PardonJulian, and #ProofOfLife have been trending in the WikiLeaks community. Here are a few ways WikiLeaks can prove Julian Assange is alive and well.
Julian Assange Photographic And Video Proof Of Life
The public is asking for photographic evidence of Julian Assange holding the newspaper with the current date.
Video proof in the form of a cell phone video or anything else could put these rumors to rest. A video with Julian Assange showing the current date has been highly requested on social media.
PGP Signed Document
Others are insisting on a link to a PGP signed document.
According to PGPI website, “PGP uses a passphrase to encrypt your private key on your machine. Your private key is encrypted on your disk using a hash of your passphrase as the secret key. You use the passphrase to decrypt and use your private key. A passphrase should be hard for you to forget and difficult for others to guess.”
If @wikileaks isn't compromised, it's easily proven by an Assange appearance and/or PGP signed doc. The longer we wait, the worse it looks.

Wikileaks Director Gavin MacFadyen Dies Of Lung Cancer
The fact that Wikileaks director Gavin MacFadyen died yesterday (October 22) is not helping matters at all. Another mysterious death of a WikiLeaks associate has left many in complete shock.
Why are people questioning Gavin MacFadyen’s death?
The Centre initially did not mention a cause of death. Wikipedia briefly had an edit which said he died after a “short illness,” but that edit was later taken down.
The Centre now posts MacFadyen has died of lung cancer. We no longer have to wonder what “short illness” means.

Many are suspicious in the way WikiLeaks announced his death to the public. WikiLeaks posted a single image of Macfadyen with no caption. The misspellings of Gavin’s name — MacFadyen not MacFayden — has everyone even more suspicious about who runs the WikiLeaks Twitter account.
@Wikileaks… you are not prone to obvious spelling errors such as these. #ProofofLife or we know you've been compromised. @FanoJung

Why would the account say it was a “bloody” year for WikiLeaks when Macfadyen died of a “short illness”?
Also, many wondered why Macfadyen’s death is listed as October 23, 2016, according to WikiLeaks Twitter account when his wife, Susan Benn, posted a tribute via their website on October 22, 2016. This, however, can be attributed to the time difference in various parts of the world. Even so, conspiracy theories ran wild.

RELATED WIKILEAKS COVERAGE FROM THE INQUISITR:
Julian Assange, 45, has a background is in physics, mathematics, and computer programming, and he is best known for his work with WikiLeaks. Assange has lived in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012, after a woman accused him of sexual assault, and another of rape, according to a 2010 article from the Guardian. The rape charge was revoked a few days later for lack of evidence, however, the lesser charge of sexual assault has remained.
Interesting Fact: The name Julian is said to be related to Jupiter, the Roman god. Jupiter presided over the heavens and light and was responsible for the protection and laws of the Roman state. In the astrological world, Jupiter is a planet which rules higher learning.
“Jupiter is a planet which rules higher learning, and bestows upon us a yen for exploring ideas, both intellectually and spiritually.”
The public awaits proof of life from Assange himself.
What other ways can WikiLeaks help to prove Julian Assange’s safety to reassure the public?

The Giants didn’t give wide receiver Odell Beckham an injury designation on their final injury report of the week, which means they had no doubt that he would be in the lineup on Sunday.
It seems there are still some concerns about how his hip is feeling, however. Beckham hurt his hip against the Ravens last weekend and missed the opening practice of the week before returning to work on Thursday and Friday. Jordan Raanan of ESPN.com reports that Beckham spent an extended period of time with trainers while the rest of the team’s wide receivers were going through warmups ahead of the Giants’ matchup with the Rams in London.
That hasn’t caused a change in Beckham’s game status as he’s in the lineup for the game. Whether he’s limited by the injury at any point during the game will be something to keep an eye on, especially after Beckham’s big game helped the Giants snap their three-game losing streak last week.
Quarterback Josh Johnson, wide receiver Tavarres King, safety Darian Thompson, safety Nat Berhe, linebacker Deontae Skinner, offensive lineman Marshall Newhouse and defensive tackle Robert Thomas are inactive for the Giants.
Defensive tackle Michael Brockers and cornerback Trumaine Johnson were ruled out by the Rams during the week. They’re joined on the inactive list by guard Jamon Brown, wide receiver Nelson Spruce, wide receiver Pharoh Cooper, offensive lineman Pace Murphy and quarterback Sean Mannion.

(Also because the people surveyed were browsing an adult toy website.)
“Masturbation is part of a healthy sex life,” says Gloria Brame, Ph.D., a clinical sexologist. “It’s totally safe and harmless.”
Just as brushing your teeth should be a regular occurrence, so too should be cleaning your pipes. Here are five reasons to take matters into your own hands right now. You’re welcome.
(To get the most out of your solo sessions, try these 5 Better Ways to Masturbate.)
It prevents cancer.
An Australian study found that men who ejaculated more than five times a week were a third less likely to develop prostate cancer.
Disease-causing toxins build up in your urogenital tract and when you rub one out, you flush the bad guys out of your system, says Brame.
It makes you harder. 
As you age, you naturally lose muscle tone ... even down there.
Regular sex or masturbation works out your pelvic floor muscles to prevent erectile dysfunction and incontinence.
“It keeps the angle of your dangle perky,” says Brame.
Aim to (ahem) arrive three to five times a week for rock-solid results.
It helps you last longer.
Taking yourself to palm prom may help you stretch your sack sessions.
“[Masturbating] an hour before a date will give you more control,” says Brame.
(When the time comes to impress your date, follow the step-by-step instructions here to give her the best orgasm she’s ever had.)
Train yourself by timing how long it takes you to orgasm, suggests Ava Cadell, Ph.D., founder of loveologyuniversity.com.
If it usually takes two minutes solo, try for three next time. Or count how many strokes you need to get to your happy place.
If you’re spurting after 50, shoot for 60.
“Most men can double the number of strokes and the time within one month,” Cadell says.
Practice makes perfect, right?
It ups your immunity.
Ejaculation increases levels of the hormone cortisol, says Jennifer Landa, M.D., a specialist in hormone therapy. Cortisol, which usually gets a bad rap as a havoc-wrecking stress hormone, actually helps regulate and maintain your immunity in the small doses.
“Masturbation can produce the right environment for a strengthened immune system,” she says.
It boosts your mood.
Masturbating releases a slew of feel-good neurochemicals like dopamine and oxytocin that lift your spirits, boost your satisfaction, and activate the reward circuits in your brain.
“An orgasm is the biggest non-drug blast of dopamine available,” says Brame. “A brain scan of someone having an orgasm looks like a heroin addict’s.”

7b26738d,https://www.yahoo.com/gma/7-ways-russia-telling-people-prepare-war-163306654--abc-news-topstories.html,7 Ways Russia Is Telling People to Prepare for War,"With tensions between Russia and the United States at their highest since the Cold War, there have been alarming signs coming out of Moscow that suggest the country is ready for war.

Almost no one believes the Kremlin is actually preparing for a military conflict with the United States. Most analysts instead see it as a show, intended to boost support at home and to deter Western countries from intervening militarily in Syria.

There are some unsettling things Russia has done, however, to give the impression that war is looming:

As the confrontation between the United and Russia has worsened over Syria, and amid speculation Washington might launch airstrikes against Syrian government forces, Russian state-controlled media has gone into high gear, asking Russians whether they are prepared for nuclear war.

“If that should one day happen, each of you must know where the nearest bomb shelter is,” a report on the state-controlled network, NTV, noted, before taking viewers on a tour of a nuclear bunker in Moscow.

State outlets, already solidly anti-American in their coverage, have unleashed themselves further, indulging in bitter denunciations of America duplicity, bombastic promises of merciless defenses and freely bandying the nuclear card. Russia’s main current affairs show, hosted by a man known by critics as the country’s “propagandist-in-chief,” warned American ""impudence"" could take on “nuclear dimensions,” then spending 40 minutes taking viewers through a panoply of potential nuclear options Russia possesses if the United States were to intervene too strongly in Syria. The host, Evgeny Kiselyov, described how three Russian missile frigates this week had sailed toward Syria to head off potential U.S. airstrikes against Syrian military targets.

""Incidentally,"" Kiselyov told his audience, the ships missiles ""also [come] in a nuclear version. Which version is aboard our missile frigates right now isn't known.”

This month Russia held a large-scale civil defense drill across the country, meant to prepare people for disasters, among them nuclear catastrophe. The drill, which Russian authorities claimed affected 40 million people, and particularly the way it was presented on state television, resembled Soviet-era exercises, with scenes of schoolchildren flooding out in evacuations and being taught to hurriedly pull on gas masks.

Russia’s defense ministry has announced how the country would function in time of war, clarifying which government bodies would take command. The answer was largely it would, taking control of governor’s offices, local administrations and the police. The military simulated that scenario during a huge exercise in southern Russia.

The maneuvers took on harder forms as well. This week, Russia deployed nuclear-capable missiles to Kaliningrad, its northern European enclave between Poland and Lithuania that put the weapons within striking distance of Western capitals. Moscow has threatened before to deploy the Iskander-M missiles to Kaliningrad, in response, it says, to the establishment of the U.S. anti-missile shield being erected in Eastern Europe. But this week’s deployment came sooner than expected, with analysts suggesting that indicated the Kremlin wanted to play it as part of the broader saber-rattling display in the confrontation around Syria.

Russia also conducted a series of intercontinental ballistic missile tests this week, launching three missiles in a single day. Two of the nuclear-capable missiles were launched from submarines off Russia’s Pacific coast, the third was fired from an inland launch pad, RIA Novosti reported.

What a Catastrophe Might Look Like

Still, despite the threats, the display has sometimes shown its seams. In the NTV report warning people to identify their nearest fallout shelter, the presenter interviewed a retired colonel ""showing several possible scenarios of the catastrophe"" on a map.

The “map” turned out to be a U.S. video game based on nuclear conflict.

Every Neighborhood Needs a Good Bomb Shelter

Most Russians don’t take the war talk seriously, laughing off the idea on the street. Most take a more realistic view of whether there's actually need to find a bomb-shelter. A photo being shared on social media showed an apartment block in suburban Moscow where pranksters or enterprising fraudsters had posted a flier asking residents to donate cash to build a neighborhood bomb shelter.

“Hurry,” the flier said. “Places are limited.”","russia,countri,russian,airstrik,missil,moscow,nuclear,kremlin,syria,war"

4e3a92c6,http://kdvr.com/2016/10/21/girls-school-photo-becomes-super-viral-sensation/,Girl’s school photo becomes super-viral sensation,"ROCKLIN, Calif. -- A single school picture can make a big impact.
A 3-year-old from California decided to wear a Superman costume for her picture instead of an outfit her dad picked for her.
Kaylieann's picture with her Superman doll has gone viral, but there's more to this little girl than just her love for superheroes.
""Pooterman,"" as Kaylieann calls him, better know as Superman, is her sidekick. He's also her wardrobe inspiration for school picture day.
""I've always wanted her to be as independent as possible,"" Kaylieann's dad, Austin Steinbach, told Fox 40.
That's why Steinbach wasn't offended when she chose the costume over the three outfits he picked for her. He's also not surprised. He said she dresses up in costume for school all the time.
""I love her wearing these,"" he said.
The 3-year-old's fashion choice went viral. Kaylieann's picture was shared all over the country.
""I'm still astonished by it. I still can't believe what's happening,"" said mom Jami.
But there's more to the story of this toddler -- she's 75 percent deaf in both of her ears.
This picture isn't just getting laughs and smiles across the internet. Supergirl's parents said they're overwhelmed with support from the deaf community. They said she's an inspiration.
""Being deaf isn't necessarily a disability that you're still able to go out there and be yourself, be creative,"" Jami Steinbach said.

Gets Sci-Fi W/ Donald Trump Roasting: ""What's The Big Blog Motherf*cker Off Star Wars?"" [Video]","Grammy-winning rapper T.I. is staying political. The self-proclaimed King of the South has come up with the perfect Donald Trump description.
In a new interview with DJ Whoo Kid, Tip does not hold back on roasting the potential next president.
“What’s the big blob motherf*cker off Star Wars? The big blog motherf*ckers, looks like a big pile of sh*t. Yeah, with the little itty bitty arms. That’s what this motherf*cker looks like.” (“Whoolywood Shuffle”)
This week, rap star Nicki Minaj ripped Donald Trump’s last presidential debate.
A few days ago, rap veteran Jeezy talked about the backlash he received for comparing Trump’s popularity to late rap icon 2Pac.
“I had a n*gga call me. I said, ‘Did your ignorant a** listen to the whole interview?’ That’s what I hate about my people, black people. We just take whatever and run with it,” Jeezy said. “To clarify what I was saying, I was saying he’s the hottest person in politics. And if he had dropped an album right now, he’d go diamond like 2Pac did, because he’s the hottest person at what he’s doing. He’s everywhere. And he really don’t give a f*ck.” (“The Breakfast Club”)
Earlier this month, R&B singer Ty Dolla $ign weighed-in on Trump versus Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
“Everybody seems to be saying, ‘Stay at home, don’t vote because we have two that are both boof as f–k.’ But we have one that’s more boof. So I want to encourage everyone to vote so that we don’t end up with a guy that says he’s going to f—ing ban f*cking Mexicans for coming out here and build a wall and make them pay for it. Like come on, man. Would you rather have a president hiding their emails and, um, lying about other things. Or, uh, a f—ing racist? I think it’s an easy call even though both of them are f—ing boof like I said. [Hillary’s campaign] is not paying me to say this.” (Billboard)

Nah, it was all because of the goat!
And for that, a couple Indians fans, noticing that the Cubs reached the World Series for the first time in 71 years, felt that the curse needed to be reenergized with a few more goats.
Alan Mancuso and his daughter, Rachel, showed up to Progressive Field on Monday with a pair of goats.

He told Cleveland.com that he owns three goats and his friend came up with the idea on Sunday.
“Everyone was really excited that I did it,” Alan Mancuso said Monday. “Especially those that know about the curse.”
Trying to recreate a curse is a risky move. One fan brought a goat to AT&T Park during the NLDS, and the Cubs still won that series.

Larry Busacca, Getty Images
Nicki Minaj did a interview recently Marie Claire magazine where she opened up about a lot of things including the racist double standard she sees in the world.
Nicki told writer Janet Mock “When Kim Kardashian’s naked picture came out, [Sharon Osbourne] praised it, and my fans attacked her for being such a hypocrite. So it wasn’t trashy and raunchy when a white woman did it, but it was when a black woman did it? It’s quite pathetic and sad, but that is my reality, and I’ve gotten accustomed to just shutting it down.”
On The Talk Sharon Osbourne after seeing Nicki’s music video for “Anaconda” she believes “That looks like a cheap porno cover of a DVD…I love women’s bodies. I love nudity, but that is cheap.”
Nicki went on to talk about Kanye Wests 2005 hit song Gold Digger and how offensive to black women it is that he claims once he hits it big “He’d leave her ass for a white girl”.

54e77f09,http://www.fool.com/retirement/2016/10/23/can-you-live-on-social-security-alone.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter,Can You Live on Social Security Alone? -- The Motley Fool,"Social Security provides a foundation for the retirement plans of millions of Americans. Unfortunately, many of those Americans incorrectly believe that Social Security's foundation is sufficient to cover their overall retirement, only to be painfully surprised when they go to collect and discover that it isn't. Don't just take my word for it. Here's what Social Security itself has to say:
Social Security was never meant to be the only source of income for people when they retire. Social Security replaces about 40 percent of an average wage earner's income after retiring, and most financial advisors say retirees will need 70 percent or more of pre-retirement earnings to live comfortably. To have a comfortable retirement, Americans need more than Social Security. They also need private pensions, savings, and investments. 
What can you expect for your benefit?
Your Social Security retirement is personalized based on either your or your spouse's earnings history. As of Aug. 2016, the average retiree received $1,350.64 per month, and the average retiree's spouse received $701.76 per month. In general, a person claiming benefits on a spouse's earnings record receives up to half that spouse's benefit. For a retiree who starts to collect at his or her full retirement age, the maximum possible monthly benefit in 2016 is $2,639.
To get that maximum benefit, though, you would have needed to earn the maximum income that Social Security taxes (currently $118,500) for 35 years. For most people, benefits are closer to the typical level than the maximum level, driven by both the high earnings needed to max out benefits and the bend points that reduce the value of Social Security for higher-income earners.
 As a result, if you're expecting Social Security to cover your costs of living, you'll want to keep those costs within your anticipated benefit level. On average, that'd be in the neighborhood of $1,350 per month if you're single, $2,700 per month if you're married and both spouses worked, and $2,050 per month if you're married and only one of you worked for pay.
What kind of lifestyle is that?
Image source: Getty Images.
$1,350 per month works out to $16,200 per year, which is above the federal poverty level for a single person ($11,800). Similarly, the $24,600 per year that a married couple with one working spouse or $32,400 that a married couple with two working spouses can generally expect to get is above the Federal poverty level for a couple ($16,020). So the typical person or couple living on Social Security alone will get enough to not starve, but won't have enough for much above the bare minimums.
While that may seem reasonable on the surface -- particularly in a low-cost part of the country -- the total picture is far tougher. For instance, once one member of a couple passes away, the surviving spouse's income will drop to the higher of the two spouse's benefit. The combined Social Security benefit for a typical couple is farther above the poverty level than that of a single retiree is, and the sticker shock of losing one income can add to the stress of losing a spouse.
In addition, you can expect fairly high healthcare costs in retirement, too. The current base Medicare Part B premium is $121.80 per month per person, and a Medigap plan to help cover what Medicare won't can easily cost $250 per month or more each as well. Indeed, the typical costs for health insurance premiums for a retired couple can easily reach $250,000 throughout retirement, and that doesn't include any out-of-pocket costs of actual medical care.
On top of the medical costs of aging, there are the everyday costs of living to consider. If you own your home, even assuming your mortgage is paid off, you'll still have utilities, property taxes, maintenance, and upkeep to worry about. If you're a renter, you'll still have to pay your rent and utilities -- not to mention things like food, clothing, and transportation that you'll still have to deal with.
Plus, particularly as you get later in your retirement, you'll likely find that you'll need help taking care of some of the things that you used to be able to handle on your own. That help comes at a cost -- a cost that can be very tough to cover on a budget that consists of Social Security alone.
Build yourself a better retirement lifestyle
Image source: Getty Images.
Fortunately, your retirement doesn't have to be limited to just your Social Security check. You can -- and should -- build a portfolio that can give you a better lifestyle than you'll get from Social Security alone. Every dollar you save up between now and your retirement is a dollar that can make your golden years all that much more golden. And if you have enough time between now and your anticipated retirement day, the growth in those dollars can be quite impressive -- potentially even making you a millionaire.
If you want a better retirement than you can get from Social Security alone, the most important resource you have is your time. The sooner you get started investing for your future, the easier and cheaper it is for you to build a nest egg that will make a real difference to the lifestyle you can expect during your retirement. So get started now and improve your chances of beating the barely above-poverty-level lifestyle offered by Social Security alone.

8f7a13f6,http://uproxx.com/dimemag/kawhi-leonard-contract/,Kawhi Leonard Celebrated His $90 Million Contract Exactly How You'd Expect,"USA TODAY Sports
What did you expect? A $15,000 cake made to look like it was made of actual money? No, Kawhi Leonard doesn’t enjoy the mind-boggling lack of self-awareness that Floyd Mayweather breezes through life with, nor does he so blissfully embrace the caricatured version of himself the way his own coach Gregg Popovich does for the media every time they point a camera in his direction.
With Leonard, everything is much simpler. He is a quiet young man who just wants to play basketball for a living and happens to be extremely good at it. The spotlight doesn’t really suit him, although his talent makes it nearly impossible to avoid. He’s not a burgeoning fashion icon like your Russell Westbrooks or your James Hardens. He still wears cornrows as if this were the mid-’90s and he was some long lost member of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, for heaven’s sake.
So it shouldn’t be any surprise that Leonard didn’t throw a Wolf of Wall Street-type orgy of excess after signing that new five-year, $94 million contract this summer. Via Dan McCarney of mysanantonio.com:
So there you have it. Leonard has more important things on his agenda, like making his first All-Star team, winning the regular-season MVP, and getting back to the Finals now that the Spurs have LaMarcus Aldridge in tow. And if today’s response is any indication, he probably won’t do much celebrating if and when those things occur.

Back in 2001, Kutcher's casual girlfriend Ashley Ellerin was brutally stabbed to death by a serial killer in her own home and the young Kutcher came within a hair's breadth of discovering her body. 
Ashley Ellerin was only 22 when she was killed
On the night of the murder, Ashely had called Kutcher to arrange a date, but the up-and-coming actor declined the offer. Later, after having a change of heart and being worried that his calls were going unanswered, Kutcher visited Ellerin's home behind the the famous Grauman's Chinese Theatre, but there was no answer when he rang the doorbell.
Concerned that Ellerin's car was in the drive and all of the lights were on in house, Kutcher knocked on the window and called out his girlfriends name, but to no avail. When he peered into the house, the then 23-year-old Ashton saw what he thought was a puddle of red wine on the floor and assumed Ashley had been drinking and left.
Ashton back in 2001
Unbeknown to Ashton at the time, the puddle was in fact Ashely's blood and her body was lying on the floor just out of view. She'd been stabbed 47 times and court documents reveal that her killer:
Slashed Ms. Ellerin's throat so violently [he] nearly decapitated her
It was a small blessing for Kutcher that he didn't have to go through the trauma of discovering Ashley, because the deliberately staged scene that greeted him was enough to scar anyone for life. Court documents state that:
After she was murdered her body was left displayed in a... demeaning pose that was sexual in nature
Ashely's murderer, local air conditioning repairman Michael Thomas Gargiulo, was only arrested for his brutal crimes seven years later in 2008 when DNA evidence to link him to the murder was recovered from the apartment of another victim who survived his attack. 
Michael Thomas Gargiulo
Nicknamed 'The Hollywood Ripper' by the media, Gargiulo is believed to a be a serial killer who has murdered at least 10 women with a sexual motive. Police profiles label him as:
a serial, psycho-sexual thrill killer who engages in the systematic slaughter of beautiful women because he takes sexual pleasure from manipulating, stabbing and killing his victims
Although Ashley Ellerin tragically lost her life 14 years ago, her murder is still playing a part in Kutcher's life today. Not only is he surely psychologically affected by the death, but he is also due to face the alleged killer when making a statement in court later this year.

A young couple were found mysteriously dead in their Dundee, Michigan, apartment on Tuesday, October 18. When investigators arrived at the scene just after 1 a.m., they discovered bags of uneaten Taco Bell takeout near the bodies as well as drug paraphernalia and a pound of marijuana on the kitchen table. There were no signs of trauma, foul play or forced entry. 
The husband and wife, who have been identified as Cameron Hulet, 28, and Courtney Hulet, 20, had been living in Monroe County for just six months, but authorities were familiar with the couple. “Cameron had some drug issues,” Dundee Village manager and former police chief David Uhl told Us Weekly. “Our department had also responded there several times on domestic issues. A lot of complaints from neighbors saying there was yelling and screaming.”
Two young children were recently removed from the home by Child Protective Services and are currently in foster care. 
While Uhl suspects drugs were involved, police are awaiting the results of a toxicology report to determine the cause of death.
“I don’t think Cameron and Courtney died from marijuana,” Uhl told Us. “But marijuana can be laced with something, and we’re having a lot of trouble with fentanyl. That can kill you immediately.” Uhl added that Monroe County is suffering from a heroin epidemic: “Our nickname is ‘heroin alley.’”
A neighbor in the Hulets’ triplex found the pair lying on the floor at 9 a.m. on October 17 and assumed they were sleeping. “She heard a groan and then closed the door and left,” said Uhl. When the same woman returned at 1 a.m. and found them in the same position, she called the police. 
According to Uhl, detectives are pulling video from Taco Bell to determine if anyone else was with the Hulets that evening.

 Texting and driving 
ST. CROIX COUNTY, Minn. - Authorities say a fatal crash that killed a 16-year-old girl was caused by a woman who was texting with both hands while driving. 
The updated information comes from the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office, who on Monday said witnesses told officers that a woman driving north on State Highway 35 had both of her hands on her phone and drifted into the adjacent lane of traffic and caused the teen driver to crash. 
Authorities responded to the scene of the crash around 3:21 p.m. on Friday, on the 400 block of Highway 35 in the town of Troy and found a 2004 Oldsmobile Bravada in the ditch. 
The preliminary investigation reveals a 2007 Ford Taurus that was being driven by a 21-year-old woman from Big Lake drifted into the lane occupied by the teen driver, from Beldenville, Wis., causing her to swerve suddenly and lose control of the Oldsmobile. 
The 16-year-old driver then rolled several times, was ejected and pronounced dead at the scene. 
Authorities say the girl was not wearing her seat belt. 
The two vehicles never collided and the 21-year-old driver was not injured. Authorities say the woman turned around and returned to the scene of the crash. Her passenger, a 22-year-old from Minneapolis, was also not injured. 
The crash remains under investigation by the St. Croix County Sheriff's Office and the medical examiner's office.

Citation Information: W.E.B Du Bois, “Returning Soldiers,” The Crisis, XVIII (May, 1919), p. 13.
We are returning from war! The Crisis and tens of thousands of black men were drafted into a great struggle. For bleeding France and what she means and has meant and will mean to us and humanity and against the threat of German race arrogance, we fought gladly and to the last drop of blood; for America and her highest ideals, we fought in far-off hope; for the dominant southern oligarchy entrenched in Washington, we fought in bitter resignation. For the America that represents and gloats in lynching, disfranchisement, caste, brutality and devilish insult—for this, in the hateful upturning and mixing of things, we were forced by vindictive fate to fight also.
But today we return! We return from the slavery of uniform which the world’s madness demanded us to don to the freedom of civil garb. We stand again to look America squarely in the face and call a spade a spade. We sing: This country of ours, despite all its better souls have done and dreamed, is yet a shameful land.
It lynches.
And lynching is barbarism of a degree of contemptible nastiness unparalleled in human history. Yet for fifty years we have lynched two Negroes a week, and we have kept this up right through the war.
It disfranchises its own citizens.
Disfranchisement is the deliberate theft and robbery of the only protection of poor against rich and black against white. The land that disfranchises its citizens and calls itself a democracy lies and knows it lies.
It encourages ignorance.
It has never really tried to educate the Negro. A dominant minority does not want Negroes educated. It wants servants, dogs, whores and monkeys. And when this land allows a reactionary group by its stolen political power to force as many black folk into these categories as it possibly can, it cries in contemptible hypocrisy: “They threaten us with degeneracy; they cannot be educated.”
It steals from us.
It organizes industry to cheat us. It cheats us out of our land; it cheats us out of our labor. It confiscates our savings. It reduces our wages. It raises our rent. It steals our profit. It taxes us without representation. It keeps us consistently and universally poor, and then feeds us on charity and derides our poverty.
It insults us.
It has organized a nation-wide and latterly a world-wide propaganda of deliberate and continuous insult and defamation of black blood wherever found. It decrees that it shall not be possible in travel nor residence, work nor play, education nor instruction for a black man to exist without tacit or open acknowledgment of his inferiority to the dirtiest white dog. And it looks upon any attempt to question or even discuss this dogma as arrogance, unwarranted assumption and treason.
This is the country to which we Soldiers of Democracy return. This is the fatherland for which we fought! But it is our fatherland. It was right for us to fight. The faults of our country are our faults. Under similar circumstances, we would fight again. But by the God of Heaven, we are cowards and jackasses if now that that war is over, we do not marshal every ounce of our brain and brawn to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the forces of hell in our own land.
We return.
We return from fighting.
We return fighting.
Make way for Democracy! We saved it in France, and by the Great Jehovah, we will save it in the United States of America, or know the reason why.

Even with the amazing advances in medical technology, it’s still be frightening for the mother and father, who will feel totally powerless to help their little one in their earliest days on earth.
So when little Freya was born several weeks premature, her mother, Laurie, was understandably worried for her little girl’s fate. But a mere five days after she first entered the world, her little angel did something to let everyone know that she was here to stay for a good, long while: she smiled.
Some people say that Freya was smiling because she was “happy to be alive,” while others still think she could sense her parent’s worry and wanted to tell them that she was safe. No matter what you might think, there’s one thing we can all agree on: She has a stunning smile, even without teeth!
Laurie posted the adorable picture and, within hours, countless parents from all around the world were sharing the stories of their own premature babies. Not only is it great to see so many happy and healthy babies, but these adorable little newborns are inspiring parents who are currently dealing with their own preemie babies — giving them hope and a reason to smile during their own trying times!
Please check out the adorable photos below!
“Our first daughter at five days old. 3 lbs. 14 oz., she was happy to be alive! This picture was one I looked at often to get me through the ups and downs of our NICU days. Life is so precious,” mother Lauren Vinje told Love What Matters.
Soon enough, countless other parents of premature babies were sharing their own stories.
Not only was it wonderful for fellow preemie parents to share their beautiful babies, but — for any parents who are, right at this very moment, worried in the ICU, unsure of their own premature baby’s fate — this story might give them a little bit of extra hope!
Within hours, parents from all over the world were sharing their children’s story of overcoming the struggle that comes with being a premature baby!
It’s truly amazing how far our medical technology has come to help save these little lives. Not very long ago, these precious angels most likely wouldn’t have made it.
So for any parents out there who are scared for their own little babies, please don’t lose hope. It can be very scary, but medicine has gotten pretty amazing these days, and the will of a little baby to live is incredibly powerful.
Please send your thoughts and prayers for any and all babies in the world, preemie or otherwise! And please watch this adorable video telling more of the baby with the smile who inspired so many parents.

PARIS – Fashion’s revolving door continues to spin furiously, with Carven’s duo the latest to depart after a short tenure.
Alexis Martial and Adrien Caillaudaud, named artistic directors for Carven’s women’s collections in March 2015, are departing “by mutual agreement,” the house confirmed in a brief statement.
It noted a new artistic director would be appointed at a later date.
Martial and Caillaudaud’s last collection was for spring-summer 2017, presented in Paris last Sept. 29 at Paris Fashion Week.
It delved into the heritage of the house and its late founder, Marie-Louise Carven. The duo zeroed in on four house codes: the Carven crest, the green and white stripes from the Ma Griffe perfume packaging, scarves and Carven’s obsession with flowers. All of that yielded a “collection with great breadth and capturing the sense of play that’s central to a fashion-loving girl’s approach to getting dressed,” according to WWD.
The pair, who met at the Atelier Chardon Savard fashion school in Paris and both went on to work at Givenchy, had succeeded Guillaume Henry, who exited to join Nina Ricci.
Martial began his career at Givenchy in 2007, working as a knitwear designer on the ready-to-wear and couture lines.
After getting his start designing shoes at Marc Jacobs, Cailladaud joined Givenchy in 2009 and was responsible for the design of accessories, including jewelry, leather goods, men’s and women’s shoes. More recently, he has consulted for Tod’s and Jil Sander.
In 20015 tapped Barnabé Hardy as designer for men’s collections, signaling a change in strategy as it split design duties for women and men following Henry’s departure.
Hardy worked alongside Nicolas Ghesquière for eight years at Italian brand Callaghan and at Balenciaga, where he helped to launch the label’s men’s wear.
The brand is among the handful in Paris to stage runway shows while competing in the contemporary designer bracket.
Fashion is enduring a period of many designer exits, with Marni founder Consuelo Castinlioni bidding farewell and Roberto Cavalli parting ways with designer Peter Dundas.

The book details his experience with the first couple during his tenure as a secret service officer during the presidency of Bill Clinton. Byrne offers dozens of accounts of obscenity-filled rages and violent behavior of the former first lady, but one story in particular stands out as a prime example of the contempt in which Hillary held those who worked for her.

______________________________________
During his interview on Monday's Sean Hannity Show, Gary Byrne told a story that ""always bothered him the most"" about his time with the Clintons--a polite gesture from a fellow secret service agent that was met with an incredibly nasty response from Hillary.
""We had a uniformed division officer who had been on the job a short period of time, nice guy, top of the line type person,"" Byrne recalled. The officer, a retired Marine who had received a Purple Heart for wounds he had received in Somalia, crossing paths with the first lady while on-duty.
""He was walking down the west colonnade and he said 'Good morning first lady.' And she looked at him and said 'go f*** yourself.'"" Needless to say, the officer was stunned by Hillary's response.
Word quickly spread, and it quickly became clear that it wasn't the first time Hillary had cursed off a Secret Service agent. The incident worked its way up the chain of command.
""It's not that it hadn't happened before, it's just that the way it happened to this guy, when it got up the chain of command and the senior agents found out who this guy was, they felt bad about it,"" Byrne added.
A lot has been made about the ""temperament"" of Donald Trump. Does this sound like the temperament of a person you would want anywhere near The White House?

Project Neon Latest, 6PM
Get ready for another significant road closure tonight impacting Interstate 15 and the U.S. 95.
The interchange between northbound I-15 and northbound 95 will be closed from ten o'clock tonight through six in the morning Thursday.
Nevada Department of Transportation officials are asking for your patience during Project Neon, the major widening project for the Spaghetti Bowl and I-15.
""Now we're starting to dig into some of the meat and potatoes work that will continue through the Summer of 2019,"" said Tony Illia, with NDOT.
Vinny Mancini was driving near the major construction zone and told News 3 he's waiting for the day this massive project is over.
""Hopefully it comes to some good ending result. But it's definitely a pain dealing with it,"" said Mancini.
The closure will allow crews to remove an electronic sign and prepare the ground here for other projects.
NDOT leaders tell us that the removal of old digital billboards will help them put up new technology in place. The new video billboard technology will minimize commuter delays, let drivers know when there are road restrictions, and lane closures.
It may be a major closure, but Illia is hopeful the timing is best to minimize the impact on our 24-hour valley.
""We tried to pick an off night like this, a Wednesday night at nighttime to try and mitigate that impact as much as possible,"" said Illia.
NDOT's detour will take you southbound on the 95 to exit on Las Vegas Boulevard and back to the 95 North.
""I was born and raised in Las Vegas, you get used to construction if you live here,"" said Eric James, a driver in Las Vegas.
James isn't looking forward to the construction to come but says it's something he's accustomed to as a Las Vegas resident.
""If they're going to build and improve on it then I'm all for it,"" said James. ""Something you have to deal with for the long-term benefit of the community.""
This will be the smaller of two closures on this same ramp.
Illia tells News 3 the same ramp being closed Thursday is going to close again toward the end of the month for 120 days.

The wreck is the third found from Tristan de Luna's 1559 fleet lost in Escambia Bay.
Ten months ago at the T.T. Wentworth Jr. Museum, University of West Florida President Judy Bense announced the first European settlement in the United States existed in what is now a suburban neighborhood off Pensacola Bay.
Perhaps lost in the hubbub of that monumental announcement was that the site clued UWF archaeologists in on where to search for the remaining four shipwrecks from the fleet that brought Don Tristan de Luna to Pensacola in 1559.
The university returned to the same museum Friday morning to announce its archaeologists discovered a third shipwreck buried under sand in a mere 7 feet of water. Field study students and staff discovered Emanuel Point III June 20 when scuba divers' probes felt stones under the sandy bottom of the bay.
PENSACOLA NEWS JOURNAL
Luna's colony unearthed in Pensacola
“We had period artifacts that afternoon from the site,” said Greg Cook, assistant professor of anthropology and principal investigator of the EP II shipwreck. “I told my students it shouldn’t be that easy.”
The UWF team discovered ballast stones, iron concretions, an articulated hull of the ship with frames and hull planking, and remnants of ceramics carried on the ship. Cook described the discovery as a team effort. Each of the students and staff played a role from diving to surveying with magnetometers. Divers searched the EP III spot after a magnetometer detected a magnetic anomaly in 7 feet of water located twice as close to shore as the previous two shipwrecks.

Cook put the historic significance of a second shipwreck discovery in perspective.
“Finding one wreck like this could cap your career. That’s an amazing thing,” Cook said. “I was just looking at the number of ships from this time period that are either Spanish or Portuguese found in the new world, and it’s only like 12, so there’s only a handful of sites. The fact that we have multiple vessels and the land site, now we’re getting this broader picture of the entire settlement and the entire expedition.”
The Spaniard Luna and about 1,500 soldiers, colonists, slaves and Aztec Indians traveled in 11 ships from Veracruz, Mexico to Pensacola. A hurricane struck Pensacola about a month later, sinking six ships and wiping out a significant portion of their supplies.

UWF students dive into Luna's history
""Eleven ships in the fleet, this is the third,"" Cook said. ""Seven of those ships were destroyed, one actually thrown up on land, so we don't expect to find any remains of that one. But six others should be out here, we think we found three so far.""
Three shipwrecks remain undiscovered in the bay, but the UWF team possibly found another one, or even all three, based on a few of the magnetic anomalies detected this summer. UWF students excavated the bay for 11 weeks as part of study in which they divided into two groups and rotated between the marine and terrestrial sites.

The wreck is the third found from Tristan de Luna's 1559 fleet lost in Escambia Bay.
“Another target near EP II is a real promising area,” said John Bratten, chair and associate professor of anthropology and co-principal investigator of EP II. “… It appears we’re in the right area to possibly find all six of them.”
A decade passed between the EP II and EP III discoveries. The 2006 UWF field study group found EP II. Archaeologists from the Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research discovered the first shipwreck in 1992.
Bratten said the discovery of EP III in shallower water perhaps indicates it was a smaller vessel than the previous two and possibly one of the earliest ships built in the New World.
PENSACOLA NEWS JOURNAL
Pieces to Luna site puzzle coming together
The Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved a permit for the UWF team to conduct test excavations through March 2017 to determine the extent of the shipwreck and the type of wood used to build the ship.
“We hope it is La Salvadora, which was built in the New World,” said renowned 16th century Spanish historian John Worth, associate professor of anthropology and principal investigator of the Luna land settlement. “We’ll take the wood sample soon and see what it’s made out of. Is it a new world species or old world species? If it turned out to be that particular one that would be really exciting, because that would be the earliest ship built in the New World that’s documented.”
A Florida Division of Historical Resources’ Special Category Grant for $290,000 funded part of the excavation. The matching grant awarded to UWF in 2014 provided funding for faculty, staff and students to conduct fieldwork, laboratory analysis, artifact conservation and curation, archival research in Spain and public outreach for two years. UWF will apply for similar grants in the future to fund further excavations.
PENSACOLA NEWS JOURNAL
Research, luck combine for epic discovery
“We’ve only opened up a very small portion of the ship, so we’re only seeing a limb of the forest,” Cook said. “We want to try to delimit the site. That’s the first thing you’re going to try and do through probing or remote sensing. We’ll probably do a bit more excavation on it. We still have a massive amount of material opened on the Emanuel Point II site.”

UWF archaeologists will be busy sorting through and analyzing artifacts collected this summer by students and staff. Worth described the terrestrial and marine discoveries as an amazing new wealth of information. He predicted the settlement will be a multi-generational project and that artifacts from the site will continue to be analyzed long after he retires.
Worth tells his students that an archaeologist is more like Sherlock Holmes than Indiana Jones. Archaeologists answer historic questions by discovering clues. The third shipwreck is the newest piece to the puzzle as the UWF team searches for answers to a nearly 500-year-old mystery.
“Archaeologists rarely get this amazing amount of information about a single event or a single thing, because not only do we have the land site and a large part of the fleet, but we have this voluminous documentary record and even more importantly UWF has the entire team we need to do a really good job with it,” Worth said. “That’s an amazing thing to me. It’s like it was fated to happen.”

Not many countries have Presidents like Rodrigo Duterte. Known for his direct speaking style and intense campaign against domestic drug users, Duterte has provoked controversy ever since assuming the office of President this past June. However, such controversy has only caused problems abroad as Duterte enjoys broad domestic support, with 91% of Filipinos saying they trust and support their president. Duterte’s rhetoric has targeted several foreign governments and institutions, though many of his harshest words have been saved for the US and US President Barack Obama. Duterte famously called Obama a “son of a whore” and told him to “go to hell” for criticizing Duterte’s domestic policies, particularly his “War on Drugs” which has claimed the lives of an estimated 3,700 people in less than four months.
Tensions between the US and the Philippines reached new heights last Thursday when, during a visit to Beijing, Duterte announced his “separation from the United States. Both in military, not maybe social, but economics also. America has lost.” Duterte also expressed his desire to align with Russia and China saying, “I’ve realigned myself in your ideological flow and maybe I will also go to Russia to talk to Putin and tell him that there are three of us against the world – China, Philippines, and Russia. It’s the only way.” However, Duterte has walked back from this statement in the days since, saying that he did not plan to completely sever the long-standing alliance between the US and the Philippines. Several US diplomats have expressed concern over Duterte’s statements saying that they are “bad for business” and foster a “growing uncertainty.”
Though Duterte’s statements show a strong desire to break away from US control, it may prove difficult in practice. The US invaded the Philippines at the beginning of the 20th century, overthrowing its newly-formed republic and turning it into a US colony for all intents and purposes. The conflict, known as the Philippine-American war, claimed the lives of around 220,000 innocent civilians and the atrocities committed by US troops became internationally notorious. US forces also forced many Filipinos into internment camps during the war where they died in large numbers from disease and malnutrition. Though the Philippine-American War technically ended in 1902, the US did not grant independence to the Philippines until after the second World War in 1946 and, even then, the independence was largely in name only. Ever since, the US has counted on the Philippines as a strategic ally in the Pacific Ocean, key to its imperialistic plans to encircle both China and Russia with US military assets.
Though Duterte hasn’t cut off all ties with the US, he has complicated US ambitions in this regard. Duterte has publicly said on several occasions that he is leaning toward banning the presence of US troops on Filipino soil and has canceled joint patrols in the South China Sea. The South China Sea has become an international hot-spot as well as a major source of tension between China and the West. Duterte’s desire to foster growth with China directly threatens this key US objective. His appeal to Russia also conflicts with US foreign policy goals. It is certainly admirable that Duterte is seeking to end the long-standing oppressive relationship between the US and the Philippines, though it still remains to be seen whether he will be ultimately successful or will fall victim to US-backed regime change – a common fate for uncooperative leaders of countries key to US plans.

5dd151bd,http://rare.us/story/tom-hanks-warm-hearted-portrayal-of-a-trump-supporter-reminds-us-that-were-better-than-our-politics/,Tom Hanks’ warm-hearted portrayal of a Trump supporter reminds us that we’re better than our politics,"In this polarizing election, it has been said time and again that Americans are more divided than ever.
We don’t need to be. Sometimes it’s nice to be reminded of that.
When Tom Hanks portrayed a white Donald Trump supporter on Saturday Night Live’s fictitious “Black Jeopardy” over the weekend, you might have expected the writers to mercilessly skewer the Republican nominee’s fans. They didn’t. This skit was different.
In a laugh-out-loud clip that continued to make social media rounds on Sunday and Monday, SNL showed that black and white Americans—even those currently cemented in either the Hillary Clinton or Trump camps—probably have far more in common that our contentious politics reflects.
Playing Jeopardy host, SNL’s Kenan Thompson (“Darnell”) was joined by “contestants” Leslie Jones (“Shanice”) and Shasheer Zamata (“Keeley”)—an all black cast—except for Tom Hanks (“Doug”) who was decked out in an American flag shirt and Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” red baseball cap.
After initial discomfort with having a white Trump supporter in their midst, the black players eventually came to see a regular guy who culturally wasn’t much different than them. Everyone agreed on the importance of saving a buck, their shared suspicion of the government, and Tyler Perry’s “Madea” movies.
“I bought a box set at Wal-Mart, and I tell ya, if I can laugh, and pray, in 90 minutes, that is money well-spent,” Doug tells Darnell. The host was so impressed he walked over to shake Doug’s hand. The women contestants high-five Doug. It was a hilarious love-in. If you haven’t seen it, it’s well worth your time, no matter where you fall on the ideological spectrum.
At the end of the skit, they get to the last category “What Lives Matter?” “Well it was good while it lasted Doug!” Host Darnell says. “I got a lot to say about this,” Doug jumps in. “I’m sure you do, when we come back…” Darnell abruptly cuts off Doug.
It was one of the funniest SNL skits in recent memory. It was also poignant.
Many of my friends sharing this clip on Facebook and Twitter said “Doug” was their dad. Hanks’ character was certainly like many I know who are supporting Trump in this election: older, white, male, middle class, sick of political correctness, but not racist. Many are simply eager for something to change for the better. To them, Trump sounds like he has different answers than the typical politician. Most of these voters are not coming from a place of hate.
 Many Americans—even those like me who aren’t voting for Trump (or Clinton)—saw people we know and love in Hank’s character, Doug.
Just like many black Americans undoubtedly see their own family members every time another unarmed black person is gunned down by police. Republican Senator Tim Scott performed a service in July when he spoke about the reality of racial bias in how law enforcement is applied, mentioning Eric Garner, Walter Scott and Philando Castile—all black men who lost their lives during questionable police altercations.
“These are people lost forever. Fathers, brothers, sons,” Scott said.
Sen. Scott’s speech was heroic because as a popular black conservative, he has the ear of much of the Trump audience—whites whose first impulse might be to dismiss black victims of police as a criminals or “thugs” instead of flesh-and-blood human beings with families who love them.
This attitude mirrors Hillary Clinton supporters and those on the left who prefer to lump all Trump supporters together as cretinous bigots. It’s both inaccurate and unnecessarily divisive.
Worse, it’s dehumanizing. Ignorance usually is.
When Doug was eager to express his opinion about “What Lives Matter,” Darnell instinctively didn’t want to hear his answer despite everyone having a rollicking good time until that moment. Even comically, it’s a divide that both sides knew would be an impasse.
We all laugh because we also know it’s true. It doesn’t have to be. There’s nothing impossible about the notion that Americans should try to better understand where their fellow countrymen of different backgrounds are coming from, whether it’s black lives mattering or the plight of the white working class.
Suggesting this might sound naïve to some. Perhaps. But so is seeking a saner politics, something that never materializes yet still doesn’t stop millions of voters from trying every few years.
We should try to understand before we judge. We should listen before we yell. We should see people before politics. It really is this simple, in theory if not in practice.
Laughing helps too.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump dismissed yet another woman who has accused him of making an unwanted sexual advance, calling the adult film actress a liar during a New Hampshire radio interview.
“These are stories that are made up, these are total fiction,” Trump said on “New Hampshire Today.” The audio was published on CNN this afternoon. “It’s all lies, it’s all lies. It was made up.”
During a press conference on Saturday actress Jessica Drake said Trump had once grabbed her, kissed her, and invited her to his hotel room during an encounter about 10 years ago. Trump addressed the accusation on Monday.
“One said, ‘he grabbed me on the arm.’ And she’s a porn star. You know, this one that came out recently, ‘he grabbed me and he grabbed me on the arm.’ Oh, I’m sure she’s never been grabbed before,” he said.
Trump has been increasingly under fire over interactions with women in the wake a of the release of a recording of the former reality television star bragging about groping women as he pleases. The candidate has continuously denied the claims as more and more women have come forward to say Trump has done things similar to what he spoke about on the tape.

The peculiarities of professional wrestling are glorious. We’ve all grown to accept the fact that it isn’t a sport, far from it, but it is still a form of entertainment presented in the style of actual competition. Not only this, but those who succeed in this pre-determined world do better financially and professionally. You don’t necessarily have to be good at your art to succeed at it.
Sure, you have to be somewhat decent to be noticed today. The days of body obsession aren’t quite over, but to say WWE’s scouting policy is the same in 2016 as it was in 2004 just isn’t correct. These days, aptitude for the ‘sport’ and the ability to put together a somewhat decent match at least are both required skills. Heck, even the big men who hark back to the past (hey Braun Strowman!) are expected to bring a certain level of intensity between the ropes.
There was a time when aesthetics were a major (read: the main) reason for certain talent getting signed, and it resulted in some of the worst professional wrestling one could ever wish to see in the mainstream. WWE was once the land of the body builders, muscles trumping moves at every turn.
But even the stinkers put in good performances now and then. Every wrestler (with the exception of Heidenreich and The Boogeyman) have had their moments when everything came together. Here are the 10 best matches of otherwise terrible wrestlers.

An insider recently claimed that Pitt has been beside himself, crying a lot, and turning to his parents for help during the difficult separation.
""He can’t believe this is what his life has become, and he’s in bad shape, but the kids are the only thing he’s hanging onto,"" the source told the Daily Mail. ""He’s been leaning heavily on his family and speaks to his parents and close friends and his manager constantly. His mom has been talking to him constantly.""
More: A timeline of Brangelina's divorce: Why did Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie split?
The whole situation is obviously terribly sad, but, for some reason, Pitt and Jolie's former bodyguard Mark Billingham doesn't seem to care about the family's privacy. In fact, Billingham's come forward to claim his 15 minutes of fame and to tell the world what his life was like with the Jolie-Pitt clan — even making the outrageous claim that he practically fathered Pitt's children.
""It was clear from the start we had a great chemistry and they trusted me with the kids,"" Billingham said in a recent interview with The Sun. ""We got very close, I was living with them all the time. I could take the kids anywhere I wanted to on my own. No one else was allowed to do that... I took them swimming. I fathered them, basically.""
""What surprised me was their low level of common sense,"" Billingham added, referring to Jolie and Pitt. ""I found it crazy when they would ask me questions like, ‘How do I go down to that bar?’ and ‘What do I need to do to get there?’ They’re not stupid, but because of the world they live in they just haven’t done something like that for so long. I found that weird.""
More: No one believes Angelina Jolie made Brad Pitt lose his friends, do they?
Billingham isn't the only former Jolie/Pitt bodyguard who has been spilling the beans. In late September, Mark Behar, the man who worked as their bodyguard on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, claimed that Pitt definitely had relations with Jolie while he was still married to Jennifer Aniston.
Don't bodyguards abide by some kind of code that states you shouldn't divulge information about the people you are protecting? Seems like if you are leaking family secrets, you might come off as untrustworthy — which could make things difficult next time you are searching for employment. Just some food for thought.

Karrueche Tran stepped out on the town in Hollywood on Oct. 21 wearing one racy and revealing outfit, just hours after Chris Brown’s new fling Cydney Christine allegedly taunted her on Instagram. Did Karrueche step out and flaunt her perfect body to get back at Cydney and show Chris what he’s missing?!
OMG! Karreuche Tran, 28, looked amazing when she stepped out in Hollywood wearing a sexy gold satin bra and pants set with matching chain necklaces. The tiny bra top perfectly showed off her washboard abs! This is exactly the kind of outfit that Chris Brown, 27, would drool over!
Karrueche always looks amazing when she goes out, but she might have gotten extra dolled up on this particular night as a way to one-up Chris’ 27, new fling, Cydney Christine. Following a cute date night with Chris at the Hollywood Horror Nights theme park on Oct. 20, Cydney allegedly threw shade at Karrueche. When a fan suggested Kae was going to “beat” her because she was out with Chris, Cydney allegedly responded, “She can try.” Whoa, that definitely sounds like fighting words!
It’s unclear whether Cydney and Karrueche have ever crossed paths before, but one thing is for sure: They probably don’t like each other. HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY reported that Karrueche was “furious” that she was getting dragged into more drama with Chris.
We definitely understand where Karrueche’s coming from. So while Cydney stooped low, Karrueche decided to take the high road by not confronting her directly! But that doesn’t mean she can’t show her who is really the boss by stunning in her latest outfit. So it looks like Karrueche is getting the last laugh this time!
Karrueche also accessorized the outfit with a set of small, chained necklaces as well as hoop earrings. And to show of her neckline, the star swooped her hair back into a loose ponytail. As for her beauty look, Karrueche opted for more natural make up, which is probably thanks to her Kaepop make-up line, which features a number of nude glosses, eye shadows, and blushes.
HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Karrueche’s outfit — yay or nay? Do you think she’s trying to tease Chris? Let us know!

Megan, from Sydney, was 12 weeks along when she discovered – much to her surprise – that she was pregnant with her son Cooper, but it turned out to be just the beginning of an atypical pregnancy.
At just 30.5 weeks, Megan told Kids Spot she went to the Campbelltown Hospital for an appointment with her midwife, but began to feel uneasy.
Megan, from Sydney, was only 30 weeks pregnant when her unborn son Cooper's (pictured) umbilical cord formed a 'true knot' and she went into premature labour
A 'true knot' is simply when the umbilical cord because tangled and a knot is formed. Sometimes they are formed when the baby turns a lot in the amniotic sac.
It occurs in every one in a 100 pregnancies and one in every 2,000 deliveries.
One of the top symptoms is if there is a decrease in activity by the baby after 37 weeks.
Despite being told to come back the following week for an appointment, a midwife began quickly became worried when she noticed Megan had very high blood pressure.
'I knew something was up. She changed blood pressure cuffs and asked me to pee in a cup again. She checked my reflexes and there was a sense of urgency in everything she was doing. This was nothing like any of my other appointments,' Megan wrote.
'It looked like I was definitely not going to work, it might be time to face the fact that there really was going a baby in my life, probably much sooner than expected.'
Doctors rushed Megan to Liverpool Hospital after scrambling to find an available bed and she said specialists came to speak to her about the risks of having a premature birth.
'They said because I was having a boy he was 50 percent less likely to survive as 'Boys don't fight' and he will require oxygen which may later affect his vision, and if I didn't get the second steroid injection he would have under-developed lungs…you get the picture. As you can imagine, I was freaking out,' she said.
The first-time mum (pictured) attended a standard check-up appointment when a midwife noticed her high blood pressure and rushed her to a nearby Liverpool Hospital, where she gave birth to 1,060 gram son despite doctor's concerns he wouldn't survive
Immediately after Megan gave birth to Cooper, who weighed only 1,060 grams, she said he was taken away to the NICU, where doctors found out the umbilical cord was tied in a knot.
The rare condition had caused her placenta to calcify while Cooper was in the womb, Megan said.
'He was just so, so tiny - and kind of see-through! Of course, there were a few setbacks, but he kept on surprising us and the staff,' Megan said.
Ten years later, Cooper (pictured) has overcome numerous obstacles, and even though he has some health concerns, he is a confident kid, Megan said
After more than eight weeks in the hospital, Cooper was still so tiny he could fit in one his dad's hands by the time he could finally go home.
The small little boy is now 10-years-old and had grown into a confident kid, Megan said.
He has since been diagnosed with ADHD, Asthma and mild Cerebral Palsy because of his premature birth.

c006d332,http://jamaica-star.com/article/tell-me-pastor/20161024/will-my-boyfriends-penis-get-bigger,Will my boyfriend's penis get bigger?,"Couple
Dear Pastor,
I am 16 years old and my boyfriend is 17 years old. My father didn't care about me.
My mother has seven of us. So I used to stay with my aunt, but when I was 15, my aunt's boyfriend had sex with me. My aunt suspected and asked me about it. I told her ""No, it didn't happen"". She told me that I was a liar because she asked her boyfriend and her boyfriend admitted it.
I did not know she was tricking me and that she did not ask her boyfriend anything. When she told me I was a liar because her boyfriend admitted it, I didn't know what to do, so I told her the truth.
She told me that I had to leave because as her niece I shouldn't have had sex with her boyfriend. He was always asking me to have sex with him and I kept saying no until I got fed up and gave it to him.
I don't know if my aunt saw blood on my underwear or what, but she knew that I had sex and it was with her boyfriend.
I had to go back home to my mother. My aunt told my mother that I was trying to take away her man, so she couldn't keep me any longer and I told my mother the truth.
I am planning to be a journalist. My boyfriend shares his allowances with me. He can afford to do so. I love him very much. I can have sex with him anytime because my mother doesn't watch me.
He has a very large penis. It is bigger than my aunt's boyfriend's penis. He always has a condom. I am wiser now. Both of us go out. His mother is a higgler. She sells in the market.
I went to the market with him and he introduced me to her. I felt special. I know he loves me. We are still in school.
I can't talk to any other boy and let him see. He is very jealous. Do you think his penis will get any larger? I hope it wouldn't.
I am glad I am not living with my aunty anymore. She prefers her boyfriend over me.
J.D.
Dear J.D.,
You speak as a grown woman. Your aunt's boyfriend has made you a forced ripe woman. I believe what you have said. He was interested in having sex with you for a long time and when he approached you for sex you should have reported him to your aunt, but you didn't.
Unfortunately, you yielded and your aunt suspected it, questioned you about it and threw you out.
This 17-year-old guy who is your boyfriend, gives you money and you feel very comfortable with him.
You are surprised at the size of his penis. You don't have to worry whether his penis would get bigger.
You make sure you try and go to school. You would like to be a journalist. Work hard, pass your exams and then go to university. You have a bright future ahead of you if you focus on your lessons and encourage your boyfriend to do the same.
I would only hope that if this guy and you are determined to have sex, use a condom.
Pastor

James McCourt, 19, hid his girlfriend Kelsie Skillen's mobile phone and locked her in the apartment they shared in Milton, Glasgow, before battering her for hours while shouting: 'You're going to have a bruised face tomorrow so I better do it right.'
He spat in her face and poured water over her as she lay helplessly on the floor. The 18-year-old feared she was going to die as she drifted in and out of consciousness.
McCourt has now been jailed for 21 months at Glasgow Crown Court after admitting assaulting Miss Skillen 'on various occasions' between May 1 and 31.

McCourt spat in his girlfriend Kelsie's (pictured together) face and poured water over her as she lay helplessly on the floor during the prolonged attack at their flat in Milton, Glasgow
He also pleaded guilty to the prolonged assault to her severe injury on June 5 and 'detaining her against her will', as well as a separate charge of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner in a taxi during the lead up to the assault.
Passing sentence yesterday, sheriff Sam Cathcart told McCourt the 'only appropriate' sentence was custody. He also ordered that he be supervised for eight months after he is released, and imposed a five year non-harassment order preventing him from contacting his ex-partner.
Sheriff Cathcart told him: 'She (Kelsi) was so badly bruised she stayed off her work for three weeks.'
McCourt grinned at his family in the public gallery as he was taken down to the cells.
Speaking yesterday after the sentencing, Miss Skillen said: 'I'm happy he has been sent away and can't get to me, I'm so glad.
'During the incident I kept saying 'Is it worth going to jail?' and he said 'I don't care if I go to jail as long as you're dead'.
'I remember thinking, he is trying to kill me. He is dangerous.'
Miss Skillen, 18, is pictured above before the prolonged assault at the hands of McCourt
The four-hour long incident started after they returned home from a night out and McCourt had left his jacket with his cigarettes behind.
Miss Skillen said: 'He said it was my fault, I had left his jacket, then he just flipped and grabbed me and attacked me.
'He had his knees oh my chest so I couldn't get up and was punching me.'
He bit her on the body, repeatedly punched her on the head and shouted, swore, and threatened her.
He then hid the keys to the flat, her phone and iPad, stopped the connection to the internet and didn't let her out his sight for hours.
Eventually he left the room to go to the toilet, which gave her the chance to find her iPad and the cable to get online - which were both stashed under the sofa.
She said: 'My iPad only had two per cent battery so I had to be quick, I was panicking and managed to get in touch with my mum.
'When she turned up I quickly ran to the buzzer - then he ran away.'
McCourt (above) grinned at his family in the public gallery as he was taken down to the cells
Miss Skillen described screaming during the attack and banging on the floor in a desperate attempt to be heard by neighbours.
She added: 'Eventually I realised the more I kept screaming he more he retaliated and attacked me, eventually I got to the point I stopped and he wasn't getting the reaction he wanted.
'That was when he started pouring the water over me. I drifted in and out of consciousness during the incident so I didn't realise it had been going on for so long.'
The hairdresser and make-up artist from Bishopbriggs said she was 'so relieved' when her mother turned up and in her statements to the police was able to relay the earlier incidents in May this year.
Defence advocate Simon Gilbride told the sheriff McCourt is suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and it was previously said he was 'ashamed' of his conduct.

Fort Worth Police Department
The ex-boyfriend of a missing Texas woman is behind bars this week, suspected in her kidnapping, PEOPLE confirms.
Christopher Revill, 32, was taken into custody on Tuesday afternoon, according to a police spokesman in Fort Worth, Texas. His arrest came one day after ex-girlfriend Typhenie Johnson, 25, vanished from an apartment complex.
Revill was detained on suspicion of kidnapping and is being held on $50,000 bond, according to the police spokesman. He was additionally charged with violating the terms of his parole, jail records confirm.
It was not immediately clear if Revill has retained an attorney. He has not appeared in court on the kidnapping accusation or entered a plea to the parole violation charges.
Detectives allege Johnson was last seen with Revill, according to the police spokesman, who declined to comment on what police have learned about the couple’s former relationship.
A search of the parking lot outside the apartment complex where Johnson was last seen turned up the missing woman’s sock, phone and car keys, the spokesman says.
Johnson remains missing, but police did not comment further.
Revill had prior convictions for both burglary and aggravated robbery, serving brief stints in prison, local law enforcement sources tell PEOPLE. He was most recently paroled in July 2015.
Police say Johnson was wearing a pink shirt with black and white pants when she was last seen. She is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 135 pounds.
Her family has asked for privacy, police tell PEOPLE.
Anyone with information about Johnson’s whereabouts is asked to call Fort Worth police at 817-392-4430 or 817-335-4222.

Ashley Graham shared a sneak peek of her new fashion spread with Fashion Unfiltered on Instagram. In it, she's only wearing a bright-red wig.
Graham captioned the stunning photo, ""And they said I wasn't an editorial girl. Sneak peek from my @fashionunfiltered story releasing Mon!""
Her caption speaks to the fashion industry slowly, but finally, starting to use models with diverse body types. Most American women are plus-size, but they make up less than 2% of the images we see. Graham's success beyond the swim and lingerie catalog realm, Iskra Lawrence walking in Chromat's NYFW show, and Aerie's campaigns with models like Barbie Ferreira are a sign of things changing.
Beyond the cultural implications, can we talk about how gorgeous Graham looks here? The hair is giving us major Run Lola Run vibes (a 1998 cult film that you should see if you haven't). Graham's skin looks like she's been dipped in bronze. Celebrity makeup artist Vincent Oquendo created her look, prepping her skin with Decléor's Neroli Hydrating Oil Serum (be right back, buying all of that) and finished her look with Marc Jacobs Beauty New Nudes Sheer Gel Lipstick in Anais.
Graham's caption is spot-on. She is definitely slaying here.

9b2d7367,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nba/charlotte-hornets/article110163447.html,No Jeremy Lin. No Big Al. Lots of new faces. How will this Hornets roster fit together?,"Charlotte Hornets head coach Steve Clifford, left, talks with Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, who missed all but seven games a season ago with two separate shoulder injuries. Chuck Burton
These aren’t the same Charlotte Hornets who pushed the Miami Heat the full seven games in a first-round playoff series.
Al Jefferson, Jeremy Lin and Courtney Lee are gone. Roy Hibbert and Marco Belinelli are here. And Michael Kidd-Gilchrist is back. It’s a team that probably won’t score as well, but could be better defensively.
How does this team fit together heading into Wednesday’s season-opener at the Milwaukee Bucks? A position-by-position look at this roster:
Point guard 
Who’s there? The starter will be Kemba Walker. Reserves are Ramon Sessions and Brian Roberts.
What’s new? Sessions and Roberts are both back with this team after trades sent them elsewhere. There is a sense of familiarity in their presence, Sessions has a knack for getting to the foul line. Roberts is a hard worker who doesn’t mind being the third option at the position. Coach Steve Clifford always wants to know he has a third point guard he can rely on, and will live with with one less wing player to lock down that spot.
Bottom line: Walker vastly improved last season and could be in the All-Star discussion as an Eastern Conference reserve. Lin’s departure for the Brooklyn Nets weakens the Hornets in that he effectively defended shooting guards last season. That allowed Clifford to play Walker and Lin together late in games. Sessions doesn’t figure to be as effective defensively against shooting guards, reducing a late-game option.
Shooting guard 
Who’s there? Nic Batum will be the starter. Reserves are Marco Belinelli, Jeremy Lamb and Aaron Harrison.
What’s new? The Hornets traded the rights to the 22nd pick in June’s draft (Malachi Richardson) for veteran shooting guard Belinelli. He shot a career-low 30.6 percent from 3-point range last season with the Sacramento Kings. The Hornets need him to provide scoring to a bench that was weakened over the summer by the departures of Lin and Jefferson.
Bottom line: Batum is the highest-paid player in Charlotte NBA history, having signed a five-year, $120 million contract in July. Batum’s gift is his versatility, providing points, rebounds and assists on a consistent basis. He took some playmaking responsibility off Walker, allowing him to focus on being an attacking scorer.
Small forward 
Who’s there? Michael Kidd-Gilchrist is the starter. Reserves are Belinelli, Lamb and rookie Treveon Graham.
What’s new? Lamb is looking to bounce back from a poor finish to last season. He played well the first 25 games last season, but wore down and fell out of the rotation, for the most part, in April and May. He has worked at getting in better shape and is more disciplined about sleep and diet to better navigate an 82-game NBA schedule.
Bottom line: Kidd-Gilchrist played only seven games last season because of two separate injuries to his right shoulder, both requiring surgery. Kidd-Gilchrist is the Hornets’ best defender and among the best rebounding small forwards in the NBA. There’s a contagious quality to his energy that is key to the Hornets playing well.
Power forward 
Who’s there? Marvin Williams is the starter. Frank Kaminsky is the primary backup. Cody Zeller, Spencer Hawes and Kidd-Gilchrist can all play some there.
What’s new? Kaminsky says he’s devoted to improving defensively. Switching from center in college to power forward in the NBA is a big adjustment, in that he has to guard opposing forwards all over the court. Playing center at Wisconsin, he mostly stayed in the lane. Kaminsky is recovering from a right foot strain.
Bottom line: Williams (who is playing with a broken left middle finger) is the prototype for what the modern “stretch 4” is in NBA basketball – he made 40 percent of his 3-point attempts last season and can interchangeably guard power and small forwards. That, plus the return of Kidd-Gilchrist, will allow the Hornets to play switching defenses and also adjust when opposing teams downsize to smaller lineups.
Center 
Who’s there? Roy Hibbert will start opening night. Spencer Hawes and Cody Zeller are available as backups.
What’s new? Former All-Star Hibbert is looking to reignite his career after two down seasons (one with the Indiana Pacers, the other with the Los Angeles Lakers). Jefferson signed with the Pacers, meaning there is no longer an obvious low-post scoring option with the Hornets to demand double-teams.
Bottom line: Hibbert and Zeller were expected to compete throughout the preseason for the starting spot here. However, the deep bone bruise to Zeller’s right knee took him out of contention for weeks. He’s just back from the injury and won’t play a lot initially. Hibbert is the best defender. Hawes has perimeter shooting and passing skills.

James Clinton Houser, 37, was arrested Oct. 3 and charged with a number of crimes, including aggravated assault, simple assault, terroristic threats and reckless endangerment, according to Public Opinion.
Police arrived on the scene after receiving a domestic violence complaint. At first, Houser told them he had been assaulted and warned them that his HIV-infected blood was all over the house.
The other party had already fled the house by the time police arrived. They were eventually able to locate her, at which point she described the terrifying incident.
She explained that she had gotten into an argument with Houser and that he became physically aggressive, pushing her into a chair and striking her in the face. When she attempted to stand up, she said Houser pushed her to the ground and picked up a glass fish, threatening to hit her with it.
The glass was broken, and Houser cut himself on it. He then allegedly sat on top of the woman and deliberately bled on her face, chest and legs. The woman still had Houser's blood on her while she spoke with police.
She said she stood up and was attempting to put her shoes on when Houser knocked her down and sat on her once again, spilling more blood on her.
After a further struggle, the woman was able to get in her car and drive away.
According to court documents, Houser spilled his blood on the victim ""in sufficient amount to transmit the disease.""
He is currently being held in jail on $100,000 bail and is set to appear in court Nov. 11.
The penalty for deliberately transmitting HIV is oftentimes severe. In September, a Georgia man with HIV was sentenced to 10 years in prison after having unprotected sex with two women he met on Craigslist, according to the New York Daily News.
James Allen Propes, who never disclosed his condition to the women, was convicted of two counts of reckless conduct by an HIV-infected person.

c3f8c55e,http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/21/europe/russia-warships-analysis-chance/index.html,Why are Russian warships in British waters?,"Russian warships pass through English Channel
 (CNN)Russia is believed to be sending a massive naval task force, with warships from its Northern, Baltic and Black Sea fleets, to the Mediterranean Sea in preparation for what could be a major escalation in the conflict in Syria. 
It's the largest naval deployment since the end of the Cold War, according to a diplomat speaking to Reuters.
Russian defense officials say there are a number of heavily armed vessels already positioned in waters off the Syrian coast.
They will soon be joined by a formidable flotilla of Russia's heaviest naval armor -- now steaming through northern European seas -- including the country's sole aircraft carrier, the recently refitted Admiral Kuznetsov.
The carrier -- the flagship of the Russian Navy -- is accompanied by submarine escorts, and at least seven other surface ships, including the giant nuclear battle cruiser, Peter the Great.
Assembling such a large Mediterranean armada sends a powerful message about Russia's military capabilities.
It remains one of the few nations able to project power globally in this way, albeit in a vastly diminished capacity compared to the old Soviet Union.
Of course, there are uncertainties.
This is the first time the Admiral Kuznetsov -- which can carry up to 50 aircraft including strike planes and helicopter gunships -- has been deployed on a combat mission.
A naval tug boat routinely accompanies the 31-year-old ship, which has been dogged by mechanical failures in recent years.
So far, Russian naval power has played a limited role in the Syrian conflict.
There have been missiles fired from Russian ships in the remote Caspian Sea and from the Mediterranean.
But these naval strikes have made up only a tiny fraction of the intense bombardment carried out by Russian forces in Syria, most of which have been conducted by land-based aircraft.
That could soon change.
Analysts say the deployment of such a large naval task force implies that Russia -- a major arms exporter -- wants to put its own sea power to the test.
Syria has often been used as a proving ground for Russian weaponry. Its latest combat aircraft have seen action there, as have advanced anti-aircraft systems and newly-developed cruise missiles.
According to Russian state media, defense officials say the Syrian conflict has revealed ""some design and production flaws in Russian combat hardware,"" which are now being addressed.
The concern among Western observers is that Russia is now building up its naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean ahead of a possible major assault on rebel positions in Syria.
The NATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, warns the Russian ""carrier group may be used to increase attacks on Aleppo.""
""That's something very different than to deploy a carrier group to the Mediterranean as part of a normal deployment, which we have seen before,"" he said
For the moment, there is a fragile humanitarian pause in fighting, with Russian and Syrian forces unilaterally suspending their attacks on Aleppo to allow civilians and fighters to leave.
But once the Russian fleet arrives, Moscow will have the firepower to push for a decisive military victory.

Kellyanne Conway, the embattled campaign manager for Donald Trump, was at one time seen as the woman who saved her boss’s campaign. The GOP nominee was floundering in the polls before bringing her on board. After doing so, he enjoyed a recovery and a brief lead before the now infamous 2005 video surfaced of his misogynistic remarks about women.
Now, it appears — through Kellyanne Conway herself — that the Republican may have stopped paying her, hinting at dissent in the home stretch to November 8. Retweeting Tamara Mae (@evil_mara), Kellyanne Conway blasted this out to her social media followers.
A shout out from @HillaryClinton at #AlSmithDinner … https://t.co/DgHcT5kkFG
— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) October 21, 2016
As Trump has found out the hard way this election cycle, retweets can be seen as mini-endorsements without the proper context.
Donald came under fire throughout his primary and presidential campaigns for retweeting messages and false statistics from accounts linked to white supremacists. The practice even became a campaign issue for him that he had to clear up on interview shows like Hannity.
Kellyanne Conway, prior to taking over campaign operations for Trump, had demonstrated a clear understanding of the inner workings of social media. Her job is dependent on being adept at the different forms of communication and the technologies that support them. In other words, when she retweets something, she knows what the implication of doing so is.
Breaking down the words of Tamara Mae from the tweet in the image above, it’s clear that Mae is making a joke at Trump’s expense, referring back to how he has in the past refused to pay contractors he did not feel were doing a good job.
Mae plainly states that Kellyanne Conway is one of those contractors and directly states that she is not being paid. Conway’s retweeting of this — until she addresses it otherwise — is a not-so-veiled admission that Trump may not be paying the talent behind his campaign, which is now struggling to stay alive in the polls.
What’s worse for the Donald, this isn’t the first time that Kellyanne Conway has retweeted something unflattering about her boss. As Mediaite’s Lindsey Ellefson writes in the site’s coverage of this tweet, Conway had previously retweeted someone joking that Trump’s “bad hombres” remark during the third debate was unapproved by Kellyanne.
Her retweet drew criticisms, Ellefson writes, “for retweeting something that boosted her profile by dragging his down.”
The campaign has boosted the profile of Kellyanne Conway, who became the subject of a parody video on SNL where she was played by Kate McKinnon. In the video, Kellyanne (McKinnon) is trying to take a day off from work only to face repeated call-ins to clear up something asinine that her boss (Trump) has done.
On Friday, people on Twitter who believed Conway’s retweet was her throwing shade at her employer wondered if there wasn’t some truth to the skit.
Kellyanne Conway ‘got a good laugh’ from SNL spoof of her https://t.co/dyC7BHvOWb pic.twitter.com/kIjt5mV8g5
— Explosion News (@ExplosionNews0) October 9, 2016
With less than 20 days remaining in the campaign cycle, it’s likely that Kellyanne Conway stays tied to Trump no matter what happens on November 8. Fans of the GOP candidate are still hoping the latest polls are wrong and that Election Day will result in a #Brexit-style surprise.
But with internal actions, such as those from Kellyanne, the probable results are coming more sharply into focus. And for any clinging to the hope that Kellyanne’s retweet that she isn’t being paid by Trump was just an oversight, she has had over 19 hours to correct it. It remains up.
But what do you think, readers? Is Kellyanne Conway implying that Donald Trump has stopped paying her? Do you think she will stay with the campaign until Nov. 8, or is this perhaps a “tell” that Trump is on the verge of conceding the race before Election Day? Sound off in the comments section.

Rihanna and Drake may be dunzo but a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that she wishes she went to his 30th birthday party on Oct. 23 anyway! Riri’s mad that Taylor Swift became the star of the show. We have all the details, right here.
“Looking back at it now, Rihanna’s kicking herself for not attending Drake’s party for one reason!” an insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Of course, everyone who’s anyone showed up to the rapper’s big 30th birthday bash on Oct. 23, and that included the pop princess herself, Taylor Swift. Riri and Drake recently called it quits, but the reason she’s so mad isn’t quit what you’d think.
“She hated that Taylor was the main attraction,” said the source. “Everywhere she looked on social media today everyone’s talking about Taylor and her outfit, her make up, her hair, and Rihanna’s sick of hearing about it! As much as she has a love/hate relationship with Drake, she’s furious that Taylor took all the attention away from his birthday. If there was any b*tch who should have been the talk of Drake’s party it should have been Rihanna. For that reason alone she’s kicking herself for not going.” Yikes!
However, Rihanna doesn’t seem as bothered by the fact that Drake and Taylor were pretty cozy at the party. That’s probably because they’re just friends and Rihanna knows that TayTay isn’t a threat, except in the battle for the spotlight. However, if another girl went to our recent ex’s birthday, and then became the star of the show, we would be pissed too!
HollywoodLifers, do you understand where Rihanna is coming from being jealous of Taylor’s attention at Drake’s party, or is she being crazy? Share all of your thoughts with us!

Ciara and her son Future Zahir are all about fall festivities.
The duo hit Fox Hollow Farm inIssaquah, Washington, over the weekend for a day filled with pumpkins, petting zoos and even a pony ride, and the 30-year-old singer documented all the action on Instagram.
Ciara and her 2-year-old son were all smiles as they stopped for a photo op in front of a pile of pumpkins, but the real fun came when animals came into play.
In one photo, a very fashionable Future — rocking a miniature NASA jacket and brown boots — posed next to a white goat in a petting zoo.
“The Goat Was Being Cool Here… Shortly After He Was Trying To Eat My Baby’s Jacket!” Ciara captioned the photo.

Future is Ciara’s son with her ex-fiancé, rapper Future. She married Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, 27, in England on July 6 of this year, where her son donned a custom Armani suit.
The mother-son duo have been keeping busy while Wilson focuses on the football season. Earlier this month, Ciara documented a duet with her little boy.
“Ain’t nobody dope as me, I’m dressed so fresh so clean,” she sings into the camera.
“So clean clean,” Future finishes, causing his mom to giggle.

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni - RTS467V
She’s one of television’s most recognizable women, a household name and one half of a celebrity power couple.
There are still plenty of things you probably don’t know about her.
 1. She can see the future 
Ripa had a dream about her husband the first day she met him. She said that she had a dream about Mark Consuelos the very first time she met him on the set of “All My Children” after he was hired to play her onscreen love interest. In her dream the pair was already married with a daughter. She told him about it the very next day.
""And he was like, 'Oh, really?' and walked away and probably thought about filing a restraining order,"" she said.
 2. Her mom didn’t want her to be an actress 
Ripa's mom was nervous about her daughter becoming a celebrity.
“She worried that I’d either get my heart broken or live under a bridge,” she said.
 3. Her dad was a bus driver 
Ripa attributes her strong work ethic to her father’s influence. He was a bus driver turned union executive. 
""My father, a bus driver, never turned down overtime, because he wanted us to have great things in life,"" Ripa said.
 4. A psychic predicted her pregnancy 
Ripa was still trying out for her job at ""Live!"" when she interviewed celebrity psychic Char Margolis on-air. Ripa hadn’t told the producers of the show that she was expecting but Margolis let the cat out of the bag.
Margolis was explaining how Ripa's late grandmother was going to protect her and her family. ""She's going to watch over you when this new baby comes.""
Ripa was understandably shocked and blurted out, ""I haven’t told my boss yet!""
 5. She can still fit into her wedding dress 
During her 20th wedding anniversary trip to Turks and Caicos, Ripa donned the same dress she wore when she eloped with Consuelos two decades earlier.
She posted a pic on Instagram to prove just how well it still fit.
“I was working on the soap [All My Children] and I didn't make a lot of money,” Ripa said about the dress in an interview. ""It was $199 on final clearance sale, and I was like, 'Do I eat this week or do I get this dress?'""
 6. She dropped out of college 
Kelly enrolled in the local Camden County College but dropped out after two weeks to move to New York City to pursue acting.
“My parents were adamant about college, so I took a few courses and then would audition for everything,"" Ripa said in a 2001 interview. ""I took things like psychology, things I couldn't get motivated to do...My father is still waiting for me to go to college.""

b71bcb07,http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/23/travel/red-river-vietnam/index.html,Northern cruising: A journey up Vietnam's Red River,"The boatman appears to be cycling.

As the small wooden craft approaches, I can see his legs rotating the oars in perfect rhythm.

I assume they must be attached to some kind of mechanized bicycle chain, but no, he's simply rowing with his legs, looking as comfortable as if he were watching TV while pedaling an exercise bike.

A woman in a conical hat squats on the very bow of the boat.

As they pass our mighty ship, a replica of a colonial river steamer, they both stare up in curiosity.

From the top deck I offer a wave and they break into big smiles as the man lifts both arms aloft, proudly advertising the fact that he can row with no hands.

It's one of many charming sights I witness as I cruise up Vietnam's Red River, considered the cradle of Vietnamese civilization.

""In North Vietnam we have an expression,"" says our guide Duoc -- or Duke, as his badge reads.

""The Red River is our mother's milk.""

Over the next 10 days he recites many a historical anecdote as we sail on the RV Angkor Pandaw from the magnificent Ha Long Bay up the Red River to Hanoi, and into the clear rustic waters of the Da River, a journey of more than 600 kilometers.

Our captain is Duc Doc, a local North Vietnamese who, perhaps unsurprisingly, cut his teeth on this network of waterways by piloting a cargo boat for three years.

""The lower part of the river is not so beautiful,"" he says.

""There's a lot of traffic, and it can get very misty in the winter months. Fortunately we have radar to detect any sandbars or obstacles.""

Nonetheless, on day five of the journey, we get stuck in a sandbar, such are the shifting sands of the current.

The captain reverses to get us out.

""So far, I've never needed to call in a tugboat,"" he says with a smile.

The genius of these replica paddle steamers is the shallow draft -- only 1.2 meters.

It means these flat-bottomed boats can navigate uncharted waters with a decent degree of confidence, and can still navigate upstream or downstream in the dry season when the water levels are at their lowest.

Duc Doc says his favorite part of the trip is Ha Long Bay, a spectacular labyrinth of karst cliffs that thrust out of tranquil waters off Vietnam's northeast coast.

These gigantic rocks are 25 million years old, and one of Asia's most photogenic natural wonders.

We spend the first night and entire next day of the cruise here, occasionally weighing anchor to explore new coves.

There are kayaks at hand for those who wish to paddle into low-lying caves.

Construction is everywhere, and hotels and casinos are going up fast.

Although the national marine park is vast and supposedly protected as a UNESCO site, up to 500 ferries a day carry day-trippers in and out of the crags and peaks.

In addition, the industrial city of Hai Phong is only a few miles south, putting the onus on tourism authorities to move quickly to prevent this scenic wonderland from deteriorating.

One of the great benefits of river cruising is that boats can anchor frequently at villages and small ports, either to pick up provisions from the local market or let the passengers take in an excursion or two.

Among the highlights of Pandaw's excursions are water puppet performances, ethnic dancing, a bird sanctuary, Buddhist and Taoist temples and visits with local artisans and craftspeople.

We see several sturdy stone Catholic churches as well, built during the French colonial period.

Visitors will invariably be welcomed to a village home with an offering of green tea.

Or, if it's evening, they might tempt you with a splash of rice whiskey.

A unique feature of the houses we see from the upper deck is that many of them have fake gables.

From a frontal view, it looks like another floor, but it's only a triangular façade with nothing behind it, giving the appearance of small Buddhist shrines atop the roofs.

Almost every building has lightning rods, sometimes four or even six, on the rooftop. They're shaped like spires, which accentuates their pious appearance.

Another unique characteristic of the northern Vietnamese is the custom of burying loved ones in their paddy fields.

Although the practice is now banned, thousands of shrines and tombstones still pepper rice fields as far as the eye can see.

Our tour guide explains that the tradition is twofold: firstly, so that the headstone acts a reminder to the family that you are still here, still looking over the household; and secondly, as a warning to your family never to sell this land.

Half-way into the trip we arrive in Hanoi, Vietnam's capital, a city of over six million people.

After the customary tours of Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum and the inspirational Temple of Literature, it's reassuring to get our legs on land with a walking tour of the Old Quarter, taking in its French architecture, bustling narrow boulevards and cafes.

Soon enough we're back on board and the ship's two 350-horsepower engines roar to life.

With a toot of the horn the ropes are cast off and away we sail.

The Upper Red River veers northwards to China, but we take a sneaky left-hand turn down the Da River (Black River).

This is the scenic part of the voyage: looming lush mountainsides and fresh countryside breezes.

Children scream as they jump into the river; men sit fishing by the banks; women wash clothes in the clear dark water.

Rice paddies are immaculately manicured, bordered by banana groves, passion fruit trees and peanut plantations.

Every now and then a fish farm appears, made from rudimentary bamboo poles and nets.

Aside from catfish, anabas and African carp (ca ro phi), villagers on these riverbanks also breed shrimps and oysters.

""Finally got to see what we came to see,"" says Andrew Baker, 72, an academic from Melbourne and one of the 22 passengers I meet on board.

With a passenger capacity of 32, the ratio of guests to staff is almost one to one, which helps explain the meticulous attention to detail.

""Boat's been wonderful; hospitality amazing,"" says Nina Grace, a tour operator from Sydney.

""I just loved it!"" adds Craig Kilgour, a retired minister from New Zealand, over his evening beer.

""I can't wait to choose my next trip.""

Cabins sleep one or two and feature brass fittings and polished teakwood paneling.

Dining is a thrice-daily feast of East-meets-West flavors and healthy fare.

The day's activities conclude with sunset cocktails on the top deck, followed by an unhurried three-course dinner accompanied by a buffet of salads, cold cuts, cheeses and breads.

For now at least, Pandaw is the only firm operating cruises on the Red River. The 10-day tour starts at US$2,600, excluding flights.","red river,river,steamer,red,boat,vietnam,vietnames,cruis,deck,river steamer"
9eb328ae,http://dlisted.com/2016/10/23/hot-slut-of-the-day-1118/,Hot Slut Of The Day!,"Froze Toes ice cream bar, straight from the ice cream truck!
Thanks to Miranda Sings and that Haters Back Off show on Netflix, Froze Toes from the ice cream truck has finally gotten its time in the spotlight.
When I was a kid and had enough money for extravagant purchases like frozen bars of processed deliciousness from the ice cream truck, I mostly spent my coins on either the crown jewel of ice cream trucks, the Pink Panther pop, or a Strawberry Shortcake. But whenever I felt like showing the kids how edgy I was, I made a controversial decision by buying a Froze Toes. (This was before my mom forbid our asses from buying from the ice cream man because her sister heard a story about how one ice cream man killed a kid and stuffed the child in his freezer. But I digress….)
A Froze Toes pop (also sometimes called a Funny Feet or Big Toe pop) was an ice cream foot with a gumball on its big toe. I don’t really remember what it tasted like, but I do remember that chewing on the frozen gumball was like chewing on stale taffy. And now that I look at it in its natural state, it looked more like Mama June’s Forklift Foot with a giant boil that’s about to pop.
Froze Toes was discontinued a while ago, but apparently pops like it are still sold at a few ~select~ ice cream trucks. But I bet that when Froze Toes was discontinued, Quentin Tarantino bought all the back stock and he keeps them in a giant freezer in his garage. Because you know that after a long stressful day, he loves nothing more than to deep throat a Froze Toes.

7c695d8f,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html?_r=0,Hillary Clinton Makes Pitch for Mandate and a Swing-State Sweep,"Hillary Clinton’s comments came as Donald J. Trump has repeatedly declined to say that he would accept the results of the presidential election.

CLEVELAND — entered the final phase of her campaign on Friday, working to ensure a victory that is decisive enough to earn a mandate for her presidency and a surge of voters to help Democrats win congressional races.

Emerging from a nine-day absence from the trail, Mrs. Clinton seized on the momentum of her performance in the final presidential debate, choosing Ohio — a battleground state where she has struggled the most against — as her first stop on a four-day swing. With new polls showing Mrs. Clinton closing in on Mr. Trump in the state, her campaign is glimpsing the opportunity for a clean sweep of traditional swing states.

Reminding voters of Mr. Trump’s refusal in Wednesday’s debate to say definitively he would accept the outcome on Election Day, Mrs. Clinton said that as secretary of state she had visited countries whose leaders jailed political opponents and invalidated elections they did not win. “We know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship,” she said.

The podcast that makes sense of the most delirious stretch of the 2016 campaign.

She also portrayed herself as a candidate who could attract independent, undecided and even Republican voters unhappy with Mr. Trump’s campaign. “I want to say something to people who may be reconsidering their support of my opponent,” she said. “I know you still may have questions for me, I respect that. I want to answer them. I want to earn your vote.”

Her stop here marked the start of a rare multiday tour of swing states as the Clinton campaign revved up its efforts to decisively defeat Mr. Trump on Nov. 8, including releasing a powerful minute-long ad featuring KhizrKhan, the father of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq. The ad featuring Mr. Khan, who was attacked by Mr. Trump after he spoke at the Democratic convention, will run in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, as well as other crucial states.

With Mrs. Clinton holding a healthy lead in most national polls, Democrats have turned their focus to trying to ensure victory by as large a margin as possible, deploying Michelle Obama in Arizona and President Obama in Florida. The larger the victory, the less Mr. Trump and his supporters can claim foul play, Mrs. Clinton’s allies said.

A month ago, Ohio seemed to be aligning as a Trump stronghold, as its large bloc of white working-class voters responded to Mr. Trump’s economic populism and America-first message. But the state is now back in play, with a pollfrom Suffolk University in Boston showing a tied race.

Mrs. Clinton’s afternoon rally at a community college in Cleveland, the heart of Democratic strength in Ohio, was aimed at increasing early voting, which began last week.

Where Republicans in Competitive House and Senate Races Stand on Donald Trump

While early voting has traditionally been a Democratic strength in Ohio, the data shows potential complications for Mrs. Clinton on this front. Requests for early ballots are down 22.3 percent in Cuyahoga County, where Cleveland is, compared with the same period in 2012. Requests are also off 12.7 percent in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, the capital, according to data compiled by Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who studies voter turnout.

A decided advantage for Mrs. Clinton here is the strength of Democrats’ grass-roots efforts. The party has leased 93 offices statewide, according to Chris Wyant, the Clinton campaign director in Ohio.

Mr. Trump’s Ohio director cut ties recently with the state’s Republican chairman, Matt Borges, over Mr. Borges’s sharply worded public doubts about Mr. Trump. “They have an internal civil war on the Republican side,” Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton’s press secretary, told reporters here.

He added that two weeks ago, Mr. Trump was slightly ahead in the state. “But Ohio is really a symbol of the progress we’ve made in the past two weeks since the first debate,” he said.

Ohio is not essential to Mrs. Clinton’s road to the White House. She could lose it and still romp through the Electoral College given her dominance in other swing states like Virginia, Pennsylvania and Colorado, according to polls.

Mr. Trump spent the day hopscotching to rallies in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, a state where Mrs. Clinton has built a formidable lead. While he projected a subdued confidence at a rally in Fletcher, N.C., he also seemed to prepare for at least the possibility of an Election Day loss.

“I don’t know what kind of shape I’m in, but I’ll be happy, and at least I will have known, win, lose or draw — and I’m almost sure, if the people come out, we’re going to win — I will be happy with myself,” he said.

At his rally in Fletcher, he offered a slightly more restrained version of his typically freewheeling speech, largely hewing to his prepared remarks.

Donald J. Trump said in Fletcher, N.C., that from now on he would be packing his schedule with events and expressed determination to win the presidential election.

Gone were his complaints of a “rigged” and “stolen” election — they have drawn condemnation by Democrats and Republicans alike — and he did not, as he has recently, try to counter accusations from the 10 women who have come forward to accuse him of inappropriate sexual advances.

The Trump campaign has said that it plans to increase Mr. Trump’s schedule in the final weeks, potentially holding as many as six rallies a day. Mr. Trump explained that he wanted to have no regrets, should he lose.

“I don’t want to think back, ‘If only I did one more rally, I would have won North Carolina by 500 votes instead of losing it by 200 votes.’”

Later, again seeming to acknowledge that he might not win the White House, he grumbled, “What a waste of time if we don’t pull this off.”

Mr. Trump’s team increasingly views North Carolina as a state that is critical to a victory in November, along with others like Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Mr. Trump’s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, visited the same town just last week.

At a rally later on Friday in Johnstown, Pa., Mr. Trump took the stage with a renewed vigor — “I just got caught in the rain,” he bellowed, “how does my hair look?” — and he returned to his theme of a “rigged system.”

Speaking to a crowd in the mill town, Mr. Trump cast himself as the champion of Pennsylvania’s working class. “The iron and steels forged in your mills formed the backbone of our nation,” he said, promising to bring prosperity back to the region. “You were the leading steel producer in the United States — did you know that?”

In Cleveland, Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Trump of buying Chinese-made steel for his high-rise buildings. “I’m going to let Donald try to explain himself to the steelworker filing for unemployment,” she said.

Seemingly energized by the more raucous Pennsylvania crowd, Mr. Trump ended his rally with a call to victory. “We will win,” he said. “We will shock the world.”

Then, Mr. Trump, who, on the eve of a campaign trip to Scotland, admitted he did not really understand the nuances of the “Brexit” vote, ended with an ebullient rallying cry by predicting an upset victory. His win in November, he said, would be “Brexit-plus.”

But a full day of events seemed to drain some of the energy from Mr. Trump, whose mood often rises on the strength of his crowds. At his final rally of the day, in Newtown, Pa., the Republican nominee began well ahead of schedule, spoke for just 30 minutes and wrapped up his speech at 7:31 p.m. — exactly one minute after he was originally slated to take the stage.","clinton,trump,voter,campaign,democrat,victori,republican,ohio,pennsylvania,swing"
fc80b598,http://fortune.com/2016/10/22/internet-attack-chinese-tech/,Yesterday’s Internet Takedown Was Powered by Chinese-made Webcams and DVRs,"The scenario experts warned about for years has come true.
Yesterday, a large-scale attack on internet infrastructure disrupted Twitter, Paypal, Amazon Web Services, and dozens of other sites, most apparently linked to the domain name service Dyn. Now, security researchers say they’ve identified at least one culprit in the attack—a massive network of hijacked Internet of Things devices, including connected cameras and digital recorders, martialed to send the gargantuan waves of domain requests that overwhelmed directory servers.
Remarkably, according to Flashpoint security research head Allison Nixon, most of the components involved were made by one company, China’s XiongMai Technologies. Those components, which are used in a variety of devices under other brands, include hard-coded factory-default passwords, which cannot be reset by users easily, if at all, making it simple for hackers to gain control of them en masse.
The software used to control these devices—which almost certainly number into the millions—is a malware package known as Mirai (the Japanese word for “future”). The source code for that software was made public by its anonymous creator earlier this month, meaning that any of a huge number of malicious hackers could have been responsible for yesterday’s attack.
For more on cybersecurity, watch our video.
According to security researcher Bruce Schneier, the attacks are likely unrelated to the escalating series of coordinated DDoS attacks we reported on earlier this month. But they are linked to a record-setting assault on the website of Krebs on Security, confirmed to be caused by a Mirai botnet.
This attack, then, is the realization of worst-case-scenario warnings from security experts about the risk posed by the Internet of Things. And there seem to be few options for prevent a repeat performance.

This is exceptional all in itself, as less than 10 sets of quintuplets are born each year in the United States. 
Here’s what makes this story even more incredible: not even doctors could believe the level of grace and calmness displayed by Mom and Dad, considering the bombshell pregnancy. Each additional baby a pregnant mother carries increases the possibility of pregnancy complications, like gestational diabetes, placental abruption, and even death. 
But Guillermina’s doctor, Dr. Tracy Manuck, called the new mom extraordinary. Despite the fact she suffered from high blood pressure and severe pre-eclampsia, not once did Guillermina complain. She developed blue and purple bruising on her baby bump as a result of carrying so many babies. Doctors were also impressed with Fernando, who provided his wife with unwavering support throughout her entire pregnancy. 
At 32 years old, Guillermina carried the quintuplets until 31 1/2 weeks. 
That’s seven weeks shorter than most single-birth pregnancies and three weeks longer than most quintuplet mothers. 
Because the quints spent extra time in the womb, their lungs were able to develop more than most other quintuplets. 
Over Memorial Day weekend in 2013, Guillermina went into labor at the University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City. Though they’d never seen a case of quints before, a dedicated team of eight doctors, one anesthesiologist, and dozens of nurses worked incredibly hard to ensure Mom and all five of the tiny babies survived. Three girls and two boys — Esmeralda, Fatima, Marissa, Fernando, and Jordan — were delivered without a hitch.
Watch the video below to see the miraculous moment all five babies are delivered. Please SHARE this with your friends on Facebook!

82e6d5f7,http://controversialtimes.com/news/breaking-chinese-military-ships-violate-us-waters/,BREAKING: Chinese Military Ships Violate US Waters,"As both China and Russia conclude their first ever joint Navy exercises, Chinese warships have been spotted just 12 miles from US soil off the coast of Alaska. The timing of the ships coincides with President Obama’s visit to Alaska.
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal:
Chinese navy ships off the coast of Alaska in recent days weren’t just operating in the area for the first time: They also came within 12 nautical miles of the U.S. coast, making a rare foray into U.S. territorial waters, according to the Pentagon.
Pentagon officials said for the first time late Thursday that the five Chinese navy ships had passed through U.S. territorial waters as they transited the Aleutian Islands, but said they had complied with international law. Analysts saw the passage as significant as Beijing has long objected to U.S. Navy vessels transiting its territorial waters or operating in international waters just outside.
The Chinese ship presence also coincides with a Russian spy ship in international waters off the coast of Georgia. Via Fox News:
A Russian intelligence ship, capable of cutting undersea communications cables and other sensors, has been spotted by the U.S. military off the coast of Kings Bay, Ga., home to the U.S. Navy’s East Coast ballistic missile submarine fleet. 
U.S. military satellites have been tracking the Russian spy ship since it was spotted in the north Atlantic last month and slowly began transiting toward its next destination — Cuba. A senior military official said the ship is now about 300 miles off the coast of the U.S., as it heads toward the island.
The Russian ship has reportedly stayed in international waters.

Michelle Martens was accused of standing by while her boyfriend and his cousin raped, murdered, and dismembered her daughter.
But shockingly, we now have even more terrible details thanks to the release of police transcripts.
Michelle initially told investigators it was Jessica Kelley, cousin of her boyfriend Fabian Gonzales, who attacked her and killed her daughter. She then changed her story to say Victoria overdosed on meth she had found.
But when police tricked her into believing her cohorts were telling the truth, Michelle revealed the horrible truth…
[WARNING - GRAPHIC DETAILS] 
She had sat and watched as her daughter screamed for help as she was raped by Kelley and Gonzales.
And this wasn't the first time. According to her statement, Michelle had watched them rape Victoria at least three times before, though she suspected Gonzales had been abusing her for over a month while she was away at work.
Michelle told police she enjoyed watching her daughter being raped, and had let two other men have sex with her in the six months before her killing, using the dating site PlentyOfFish to find men who wanted to sleep with the then 9-year-old. Police reportedly now have those men's names.
One of the most disturbing details of the grisly murder? After Michelle watched Gonzales and Kelley kill Victoria and then cut up and burn her body, she had sex with Gonzales 20 minutes later.
All three adults are being held on $1 million bonds. They are expected to go to trial next year.

By JOSH LEDERMAN and JILL COLVIN
 Associated Press
GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) - Throwing his campaign off-kilter once again, Donald Trump vowed Saturday to sue every woman who has accused him of sexual assault or other inappropriate behavior. He called them ""liars"" whose allegations he blamed Democrats for orchestrating.
Trump's blunt threat of legal action eclipsed his planned focus on serious-minded policy during a speech in Gettysburg. Though his campaign had billed the speech as a chance for Trump to lay out a to-do list for his first 100 days as president, he seemed unable to restrain himself from re-litigating grievances with Hillary Clinton, the media and especially the women who have come forward in recent days.
""All of these liars will be sued once the election is over,"" Trump said. He added later: ""I look so forward to doing that.""
Ten women have publicly accused Trump of unwanted advances or sexual assault in the weeks since a 2005 recording emerged in which the former reality TV star boasted about kissing women and groping their genitals without their consent.

Three other terrorist leaders were also affected by the assassination attempt.
Baghdadi is credited with transforming the militant group al-Qaeda in Iraq into the powerful jihadist militant group that currently controls large parts of Syria and Iraq, according to the Daily Mail.
U.S. officials have been trying for years to capture or kill Baghdadi, going so far as to offer a $10 million reward in 2011 for any information regarding his whereabouts. Earlier this year, it was falsely claimed that he had been killed in an air strike.
The U.S. may now have reasons to celebrate after a long campaign of unsuccessful assassination attempts. 
""There were intelligence reports that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and three leading commanders consumed food containing poison,"" said a source close to ISIS, according to the AhlulBayt News Agency. 
Baghdadi is apparently ""suffering from severe poisoning"" and he and the other three commanders have been taken to an unknown location where they will be cared for under strict supervision. 
Unlike al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who regularly made his appearance known through publicized messages, Baghdadi is more reclusive and constantly on the move throughout Iraq and Syria in order to avoid air strikes. According to AhlulBayt, this means that only those closest to al-Baghdadi ever know his location, which could imply that the assassination attempt came from inside the leader's inner circle. 
The incident occurred near the Syrian border in the south-west of Mosul, AhlulBayt reports. ISIS has already begun a campaign of arrests in the area to find and most likely kill those responsible.
This event comes after a number of senior ISIS leaders were killed during a meeting when a malfunction caused one of the attendee's explosive belts to detonate, according to The Daily Mail.
A statement from the Al-Sumaria Iraqi media outlet stated that ""The meeting was held to prepare for an attack on the positions of the security forces in Hamrin Mountains, al-Zawiya area and Ajil area in Salahuddin Province.""
The Daily Mail reports that 16 jihadists were killed in total.

The highlights of Microsoft's latest earnings come in the form of Office and Cloud. Office commercial revenue grew 5 percent, while Office consumer revenue was up 8 percent in the latest quarter. Revenue in what Microsoft describes as ""intelligent cloud"" rose 8 percent, with Azure revenue up 116 percent, and server revenue up 11 percent.

On the Windows side, OEM revenue was flat year-over-year, but phone revenue decreased a massive 72 percent. Considering Microsoft has given up on phone hardware, that's hardly a surprise, and it's likely we'll see this decrease further in future quarters. Gaming revenue declined by 5 percent, and Microsoft blames ""lower Xbox console revenue"" for the dip. Despite the Xbox hardware sales, Xbox Live active user count has risen to 47 million in the recent quarter, up from 39 million a year ago.

Surface is once again a good spot in Microsoft's earnings. Surface revenue hit $926 million in the quarter, up 38 percent from the $672 million last year. Both Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book will have helped push that revenue up, and Microsoft is expected to launch a new Surface all-in-one PC at an event next week that will likely contribute to the company's next quarter of Surface sales.

Microsoft acquired LinkedIn recently, and the company plans to finalize the deal in the second fiscal quarter. Microsoft plans to incorporate LinkedIn into the productivity and business segments of its earnings results, but we'll have to wait until next quarter to find out the true financial impact of the merger.

Microsoft's impressive earnings have helped the company hit an all-time high stock price in early after-hours trading. Microsoft's stock jumped above $60, for the first time since December, 1999. Microsoft will be holding an investor call at 5PM ET, and we'll update this article with any noteworthy additions.","revenu,quarter,earn,microsoft,percent,cloud,hardwar,decreas,quarter revenu,surfac"

According to a statement of probable cause, 57-year-old Richard Loren Denison faces one count of aggravated sexual assault as a first-degree felony and one count of sexual solicitation as a class B misdemeanor.
The charges stem from an incident on October 12, when Denison allegedly invited an escort to a home and agreed to pay her to dance and strip for him.
The victim told police Denison asked her to engage in “fetish games” once she had stripped off some of her clothes, and when she refused he allegedly pushed her onto a bed and strangled her until she lost consciousness.
The woman woke up later, and Denison allegedly strangled her again until she lost consciousness once more. When she woke up the second time she said she was bound by the wrists and neck with the tights she had been wearing earlier. The knots were so tight she lost circulation in her hands.
The alleged victim was able to contact a driver with the escort service to come get her and take her to seek medical attention, where she reported the assault. Medical personnel observed injuries consistent with assault on her body.
Police responded to a home in Taylorsville, where Denison admitted to meeting with two escorts recently. Officers located items of clothing the victim described and said she had left behind in the home.
Denison has a previous conviction for attempted sexual abuse of a child, a third-degree felony. The charging documents state this qualifies Denison for lifetime registration on the Sex Offender Registry.

Holly Hagan lashes out at reality show producers on Twitter as she claims they 'barely fed us once a day',"She only announced she was quitting the MTV reality show on Tuesday.
But it seems Holly Hagan's departure from Geordie Shore has been far from amicable with the series' producers.
Taking to her Twitter page on Wednesday the blonde, 24, appeared to criticise the treatment of the cast behind the scenes - writing to one follower that the bosses 'barely feed us once a day if we beg' and set out to stir drama between the group.

Hitting back: Holly Hagan, 24, hit out at MTV producers on Wednesday after she claimed on Twitter they 'barely feed us once a day'
The busty blonde first kicked things off by criticising fellow reality show Ibiza Weekender.
Writing of show bosses' need to purposely stir drama, she posted: 'When you know the producers have told Ellie to go in the girls room and chat to mug her off even more in the edit✋ #ihatetv'
Despite showing sympathy for the ITV reality stars on screen, Holly's tweet received immediate backlash, with one fan retorting: 'You mean reality TV isn’t real?! shocking reveal. Talk about biting off the hand that feeds you! You’ve made ££ from reality TV.'
Awkward! Holly claimed producers 'barely feed us once a day' after receiving backlash for a tweet criticising the editing of ITV reality show Ibiza Weekender
Hitting a nerve, Holly was quick to respond - drawing on her own experience on reality TV by replying: 'I’m allowed to have empathy for a situation I’ve been in.It’s not nice to watch. P.s they barely feed us once a day if we beg.'
A representative for MTV declined to comment when MailOnline contacted them about the matter.
The claims come after the television personality was reported to have turned her back on Geordie Shore, after appearing in it for five years.
A source told The Sun: 'Holly formally told producers she was off earlier this month. She’s got her own projects to follow and there’s a whole new cast that’s come in and she’s feeling that it’s really time to move on.
Another one bites the dust! The tweets come just two days after Holly reportedly 'quit Geordie Shore following Charlotte Crosby's departure'
'It ultimately comes down to Charlotte quitting earlier this year prompted her to do something that she’d been thinking about for a while. Producers have asked her to reconsider but so far she’s stuck to her guns.'
'Gaz has openly admitted that he doesn’t see himself on the show beyond next year and wants to leave for a new life in Oz while Vicky Pattison is long gone.'
The insider added: 'Holly has had enough and has been telling people she's done with the show.'
It was previously revealed Holly had been struggling on the show since her best friends Charlotte Crosby and Chantelle Connelly both quit - while Aaron Chalmers has announced he will bow out in 2017.
A spokesperson for MTV has declined to comment to MailOnline.
Farewell: A source told The Sun 'She’s got her own projects to follow and there’s a whole new cast that’s come in and she’s feeling that it’s really time to move on.'
Following her friend: The source explained: 'It ultimately comes down to Charlotte quitting earlier this year prompted her to do something that she’d been thinking about for a while'
Meanwhile, Holly has been working on her figure and has transformed from a curvy size 16 to a tiny size 10.
And it looked as though she was celebrating her weight loss on Monday, as she posted a throwback picture of her looking very different from her current look on Instagram.
The show's stalwart reminded her fans of when she had blooming red hair back in 2013 - although her assets were just as ample.
Bored of it? The insider added: 'Holly has had enough and has been telling people she's done with the show'
Missing the memories: It was previously revealed Holly was struggling on the show as her best friends Charlotte Crosby and Chantelle Connelly have all quit
She compared a snap of her donning a skin-tight leather blouse that pushed her assets together with a more recent pic of her sporting long blonde tresses.
In the more recent snap, Holly donned a sheer top that showed off a little too much of her surgically enhanced assets as she went braless.
In reference to her continuing fitness regime, she captioned the photo: '#motivation #monday'.
On Wednesday, Holly was certainly showing off all her best assets, particularly her 'Double Fs', as she sizzled for a super sexy selfie posted to Instagram.
She looked incredible in just a bra as she sizzled for her 3.2million followers in what is just one in her usual string of saucy snaps.
Focusing on herself: Meanwhile, Holly has been working on her figure and has transformed from a curvy size 16 to a tiny size 10
The last we'll see of her? Holly was in London alongside on/off beau Kyle Christie (second from right) earlier this month to promote the new series of Geordie Shore
Staying power: Holly alongside Gaz was the only original member of the cast still left in the show who had starred in every series since it launched in 2011
The reality starlet spoke exclusively to MailOnline about her widely-discussed physique before revealing the painful words issued to her by trolls which even saw a follower 'wishing her mum was dead'.
Despite her new career as a diet guru, Holly admits she must make room for her television job - which naturally calls for her to slot into the Geordie Shore lifestyle of bedding, brawling and most importantly boozing.
She said: 'It's so difficult balancing my job and my weight - I do fluctuate. I'm an all or nothing girl. There's no in between for me. I know it's not the healthiest way to live but while it's my job to go out and get drunk, I need to accept it.'
Holly's change of heart about the show follows her success outside of the reality platform with her own diet book.

The bubbly lass alongside Gaz was the only original member of the cast still left in the show who had starred in every series since it launched in 2011.
The Middlesbrough native was only 18 when she appeared on the reality show, which quickly became a controversial success with its mix of bad behaviour and on-screen romps.
Holly's stint on the show has seen the Northern lass struggle with her romantic life.
After enjoying a romp with Gary the first ever episode of the show she went on to develop a crush on former co-star James Tindal.
However, after James found love she became romantically entangled with Scotty T, before finding love with on/off beau Kyle Christie.

Back on: The are they/aren't they couple appear to be having a smooth patch at the moment, and have recently snapped pictures together as well as turned up to events arm-in-arm
Their romance has played out on camera, and has even affected the make-up of the show, with their toxic relationship causing Kyle to receive the boot from the rest of the cast in Series 11 (2015).
Holly is no stranger to making headlines outside of the show. In 2011 the reality star enjoyed a one night stand with X Factor flop Frankie Cocozza.
Frankie left presenters Olly Murs and Caroline Flack shocked when they quizzed him over his much-publicised flirtation with Holly.
Asked by Xtra Factor hosts Caroline and Olly what had happened with her, Frankie crudely replied: 'I met her... I banged her.'

Missing her? Holly's alleged decision to quit the show comes just months after her best friend Charlotte Crosby sensationally walked out on the programme
Realising he may have pushed the boundaries on the ITV2 show with the comment, Frankie put his hand to his mouth and said: 'Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.'
Holly's alleged decision to quit the show comes just months after her best friend Charlotte Crosby sensationally walked out on the programme.
The 26-year-old decided to leave the reality show after finding out her on/off boyfriend Gary had had a fling with fellow MTV star Jemma Lucy.
Speaking about her decision to leave the popular show, which catapulted her to fame, she told Daily Mail Australia: 'It's probably the best decision I’ve made in my life.'
A few days before the Geordie lass took to social media to vent about the problems she had on the show.
She wrote: ''When you realise you made what seems like the worst decision of your life.....I've lost my family....my life. Cast and CREW [sic].'

The mindset of Europe changed from Eurocentric to outward looking, from that point forward. Polo is even said to have inspired Christopher Columbus, whether for good or ill, you be the judge. The past often seems fixed and unyielding. But a discovery like this shows that it is actually more malleable that we assume. This is one of those moments where our understanding of historical development are altered irrevocably.
Alexander the Great’s India campaign in 326 BCE introduced the West to the East. Greek philosophy and art left an impression on India in the conqueror’s wake. Previously, there was no evidence of interaction between ancient Greece and China. We have known of some contact between the Roman Empire and the Middle Kingdom in the second and third centuries, CE.
The Silk Road was established in the third century, during the Han Dynasty, a trade route which was really nothing more than a series of caravan stops connecting the West to China. There are some Chinese accounts of Roman traders making it to their land before the Silk Road was even finished. In the time of Emperor Augustus, silk is known to have flooded into Rome and quickly became a favorite among the city’s aristocratic women. After the fall of the Roman Empire however, contact ceased until Polo.
Greek statuary is now thought to have inspired the Terra Cotta Warriors. 
Now, it’s believed that Greek statuary may have made it to China in the fourth century, sometime after Alexander’s campaign. Mitochondrial DNA taken from skeletons at the site of the first emperor’s tomb puts Europeans in close contact with the Chinese far earlier than previously thought. These Europeans interbred with the local population at the time when the statues were created.
Xian was the first capitol of a united China. Emperor Qin Shi Huang brought together the warring states under his flag in the third century BCE, mostly through war and bloodshed. He was born in 259 BCE and rose to power at the age of 13. After unifying the country, he built roads and canals, standardized coinage and weights and measures, put forth policies to stabilize the country, ended feudalism, and decreed what would become the first attempt at the Great Wall.
He died in 210 BCE. Emperor Qin’s inability to ensure his eldest son’s ascension saw a quick end to his dynasty, as a bloody power struggle erupted after his death. The emperor’s mausoleum however has enjoyed far more longevity than his dynasty. No one has been inside since it was sealed shut.
Archeologists recently discovered that the tomb site is far larger than first thought. Spanning an impressive 38 square miles (98 square kilometers), Qin’s mausoleum complex is 200 times that of Egypt’s Valley of the Kings. From the outside, the tomb looks like an imposing green hill. Ancient texts proclaim an ostentatious complex housed within. An entire palace built exactingly down the last detail, is housed within. Pearls adorn the cavern ceiling, arranged in the constellations of the night sky, and inside the palace, opulent rooms contain all the vestments, tools, and comforts befitting an emperor enjoying the afterlife.

Rivers of mercury surround the mausoleum-palace making the air poisonous. This was not done to prevent grave robbing, though it has successfully done so. Instead, it was part of an ancient belief, to help ensure immortality. Archeologists learned more about the mausoleum complex by using ground-penetrating radar, taking core samples, and using remote sensing technology in these newly discovered areas.
Less than a mile from the mausoleum site, 8,000 warriors, each somewhat different, guard the emperor in the afterlife, or so it was thought. Rather than kill all his servants and bury them with him, Qin decided that clay representations would suffice, lucky for them. The warriors were eventually lost to history until a flustered farmer unearthed one in 1974. Since that time, 2,000 individual warriors have been excavated.
The makeup of the army varies widely. There are generals, charioteers, infantrymen, archers, and cavalry. Other statues including acrobats, dancers, strong men, even civil servants. It isn’t only the magnitude and variety among the statues that makes them remarkable, but the close attention to detail in each.
The faces vary from one to the next. Beyond that, there are chariots, horses, weapons, clothing, insignias, elaborate hairstyles such as topknots, and more. You can even tell what rank each one is by their clothes and accoutrements. Though a truly impressive feat, there is of course a dark underside. Over 700,000 conscripts endured forced labor for nearly thirty years to complete the warriors and the palace complex. 
The sheer enormity is impressive enough, but the differentiation and attention to detail makes this site spectacular. 
Dr. Li Xiuzhen is the Senior Archeologist at Emperor Qin Shi Huang’s Mausoleum Site. Not only is there proof of contact with the West, according to Dr. Xiuzhen, “We now think the Terra Cotta Army, the acrobats and the bronze sculptures found on site, have been inspired by ancient Greek sculptures and art. “ Before this, Chinese craftsmen had no tradition of building statues that were life-sized, or lifelike. This was not something the Greeks learned overnight, but took centuries to develop.
Professor Lukas Nickel supports the Greek traveler’s theory. He is the chair of Asian Art History at the University of Vienna. Prof. Nickel recently translated an ancient text telling of certain lifelike, human statues appearing in western China during the reign of Emperor Qin. He now believes a Greek master craftsman must have been onsite to teach techniques to local sculptors.
DNA evidence suggests that not only were Europeans present in Xinjian province earlier than thought, European settlements may predate Chinese ones in the region. This is China’s westernmost province. Europeans may have even lived there during the emperor’s reign. Even so, some are calling for more evidence, as these new theories could soon become controversial.
The differences in faces and facial expressions from one to another is remarkable. 
Other discoveries at the mausoleum site included about a hundred tombs containing the mutilated skulls of young women. Though archeologists aren’t sure, they are believed to have been concubines, perhaps slaughtered in order to serve the emperor in the afterlife. Or they may have been killed so as to wipe out any chance of an heir someday rising up and claiming the throne. Archeologists found jewelry made of gold and pearls among their remains. Many other people are buried in this newly discovered area of the complex, including the mass graves of craftsmen and workers, and even criminals who were still in chains. These people must have died during the mausoleum’s creation, experts say.
The skull of a young man with a crossbow bolt stuck in it was also discovered. This is thought to be the remnants of the emperor’s eldest son, Prince Fu Su, who was killed during a power struggle following his father’s death. Other skeletons were found alongside the prince. After the emperor died, a younger son conspired with the chief eunuch in order to seize the crown. They wiped out the clan’s other princes and enjoyed a short lived success. For all his violence, this usurper, Qin Er Shi, never could live up to his father’s name, and he was overthrown just three years later.

Former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) on Sunday defended Donald Trump after saying the Republican presidential nominee has two personalities — a ""big Trump"" and a ""little Trump.""
 ""Of course you can,"" the former Speaker, a top Trump adviser, said when asked on ""Fox News Sunday"" if the country could afford to have a president with such a split personality. 
""I think we had a number of presidents who had interesting challenges in their personality.""
Gingrich earlier this month called little Trump ""frankly pathetic,"" after the Republican nominee attacked Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) for distancing himself from Trump just weeks before the election.
“Look, first of all, let me just say about Trump, who I admire and I’ve tried to help as much as I can. There’s a big Trump and a little Trump,” Gingrich said.
“The little Trump is frankly pathetic. I mean, he’s mad over not getting a phone call?""
Gingrich on Sunday, though, touted Trump as a far superior candidate than his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.
""I'm willing to concede that Trump on occasion is crass, but I'd like my opponents to concede that Hillary on occasion is corrupt,"" he said.
""You have a candidate for president who under any reasonable standard would have been indicted,"" Gingrich continued.
""Trump is not perfect, but she sure ain't perfect, either, and she's a much greater threat to our system than Donald Trump is.""

A quick vitamin D primer
You walk in the sunshine every day (wearing your SPF of course). You eat right. You get enough sleep. But you still may be missing something even if you’re doing all the right things—vitamin D. Though rare, severely low levels of vitamin D can cause rickets in children and osteomalacia (softening of the bones) in adults. Left untreated, these conditions can lead to bone pain, soft and brittle bones, and muscle pain and weakness, according to the Cleveland Clinic. But recent research has suggested a connection between even moderately low levels of vitamin D and a number of surprising health conditions, including diabetes, osteoarthritis, and cancer. Here are a few sneaky signs that you might not be getting enough vitamin D. If you feel that you’re suffering from any of these symptoms, talk with your healthcare provider, who will likely recommend a blood test. This is really the only way to accurately determine your vitamin D level. Then you can discuss ways to boost your levels, typically by taking an over-the-counter supplement.
You’re tired all the time

If you aren’t getting enough vitamin D, you may feel completely exhausted, even if you get plenty of sleep. “There is mounting evidence that vitamin D deficiencies are associated with fatigue and sleep disorders,” says Catherine G. R. Jackson, PhD, a professor of kinesiology and exercise science at California State University in Fresno. A study in the North American Journal of Medical Sciences found that low vitamin D levels were prevalent in people who are fatigued. Taking more vitamin D helped improve their symptoms. Here are other sneaky reasons you may be tired all the time.

Having the blues may be linked to an insufficient amount of vitamin D. According to the Vitamin D Council, vitamin D receptors have been found in many parts of the brain, including in areas linked to depression. Research shows a link between low levels of vitamin D in the blood and depression symptoms. But it’s still unclear exactly what that link is—whether low vitamin D levels develop because someone is depressed or whether low vitamin D levels may actually cause depression. Pay attention to these 8 warning signs of depression.

Sweatiness on the forehead is one of the first classic noticeable signs of vitamin D deficiency. If you look like you’re glowing even when your body temperature and activity levels are normal, you may need more vitamin D. Try eating more of these vitamin D-rich foods.
Your bones hurt

Adults who don’t get enough vitamin D often have aches and pains in their muscles and bones, especially in the winter. Their joints are also a little stiffer in the morning. “Many aches and pains are symptoms of the classic vitamin D deficiency, osteomalacia,” says Sonya Angelone, MS, RDN, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Soft bones are more likely to bow and fracture than ones that are healthy and hard.
You’re experiencing erectile dysfunction

If you or your sexual partner is suffering from erectile dysfunction (ED), lack of vitamin D may be to blame. A study in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that men with severe ED had significantly lower levels of vitamin D than those with mild cases of ED. Men diagnosed with ED often have cardiovascular disease, which is also associated with a lack of vitamin D. Some experts suggest that treating a vitamin D deficiency may decrease the risk of ED, says Angelone.
You're prone to stress fractures

“Most people think of a lack of calcium when talking about bone health, which is true. However, without vitamin D, calcium doesn’t get absorbed properly,” says Jennifer Giamo, a nutritionist, certified personal trainer, and founder of New York City-based Trainers in Transit (who has also run seven marathons). “Vitamin D, specifically D3, which increases calcium absorption, is critical to preventing bones from becoming thin and brittle.” A study in The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery found that people who participate in higher-impact activities may need greater levels of vitamin D to reduce their risk of stress fractures.
Your athletic performance could be better

Insufficient vitamin D may impact your fitness levels and muscle function. “You may not even realize you’re not performing at your best,” says Paige Waehner, a certified personal trainer, author of The About.com Guide to Getting in Shape and the Exercise Expert at About.com. An analysis published in the American College of Sports Medicine’s Health & Fitness Journal found that vitamin D supplements improved the physical performance in those diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency. “Vitamin D deficiency is linked to increased inflammation. And after intense exercise, the body is inflamed,” says Giamo. “If adequate amounts of vitamin D are already in the bloodstream, then the speed of recovery from intense exercise is increased.” Giamo warns, though, not to take vitamin D supplements if you aren’t deficient in the nutrient because it’s unlikely you’ll improve your athletic performance or recovery rate. “Since vitamin D is a fat-soluble hormone that doesn’t get excreted by the body, it could be potentially harmful if you take too much,” says Giamo.
You can’t get a good night’s sleep

Researchers found that people who took more vitamin D had a 16 percent lower risk of having trouble getting a full night’s sleep, according to a study published in the Journal of Sleep Research.Another large study looked at 1,500 neurological patients over a two-year period who also had abnormal sleep. “The sleep improvement with [vitamin D] supplementation was measurable,” Dr. Jackson says.
You catch everything going around

Colds, viruses, the flu: You name it, you get it. “Vitamin D deficiencies are associated with depressed immune systems,” says Dr. Jackson. “You’ll catch whatever is going around if your immune system isn’t functioning properly.” A study in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that adults who have low levels of vitamin D are more likely to report having had a recent cold, cough, or upper respiratory infections. Higher levels of vitamin D may also help decrease recovery time from the flu.

 Those who don’t believe in the spirit life after death may change their tune after checking this out. Usually it’s some sort of visual proof one needs, and this accident video certainly provides just that. A tragic accident occurs when a truck hits a woman on a motorcycle. The woman hits a telephone pole, dies right away. Then this happens. You’ll likely have to review it several times as it’s hard for even the believers out there to realize what they are witnessing.
 The bike gets hit and the woman goes right into the power pole. That’s when suddenly a black silhouette of a person can be seen, haven risen out from the woman’s body.
 This certainly gives a lot of thought about the idea of afterlife, spirits, and so forth. Rarely do we see a death on video, as it happens. Especially one where the person dies instantly. Often people can remain alive after horrific accidents, part of their vitals still operating. But here, it is more than clear, that a life has indeed ended in brutally instant fashion. And with that, be warned that indeed it is pretty graphic, though it goes by quick. It’s a death and it’s not pleasant to view, but many may believe the fascinating after-image is showing a new life of spirit beginning.
 Share with others who can handle such a video and start a discussion on whether it appears real and could in fact be footage of an actual spirit leaving one’s body!

You pick up a harmless snake and it turns into a deadly viper.
This is what happened to Colin Strine from Sakaerat Environmental Research Station in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, during a field trip with his team to a biodiversity hotspot in the north-east of the country where at least 176 snake species are found. He instinctively dropped it and the snake fled.
But it turns out Strine might have been fooled by a never-before-seen behaviour: a snake changing the shape of its eye pupils when attacked to resemble those of a deadly relation.

Mock viper: unthreatened (left) and threatened (right)
Further investigation revealed that the snake he picked up really was harmless: a mock viper (Psammodynastes pulverulentus) that has evolved several features to look like its venomous distant cousins, Malayan pit vipers (Calloselasma rhodostoma).
“Thailand is the land of mimics for snakes,” says Strine. “Most of the highly venomous snakes also have a non-venomous mimic counterpart.”
Eye spy
This is true of the mock viper, which has the triangular head, cryptic colour pattern and enlarged front teeth of its lethal relation. But it also appears to have gone a step further and evolved to change the shape of its rounded pupils into the vertical slits typical of a venomous viper when attacked.
Strine’s team was intrigued by the event and wanted to see it again. So, over the last four years of a biodiversity project in Thailand, they captured 36 individuals showing this behaviour.
One question is whether it evolved as part of the snake’s elaborate mimicry. “We are not even sure if it is a defensive strategy or just something that happens when the viper is gripped,” Strine says.
Another possibility is that vertical pupils appear less conspicuous, helping the snake obscure the outline of its head. Or it could be that constricting its pupils improves the mock viper’s vision, so increasing the accuracy of its defensive strike.
“I would love to look at this behaviour in a controlled lab setting because it may be that the behaviour has limitations based on aggressor species, stimuli and other environmental factors,” Strine says.
“It’s a very interesting observation but, as the authors say, it raises lots of questions,” says Gonçalo Rosa at the University of Nevada in Reno. “If this is indeed a defensive strategy for mock vipers, it is possible that we might find it in other species that share their habitat with true vipers.”

83a7a5bd,http://www.self.com/story/pregnant-while-breastfeeding,Don't Listen To Anyone Who Says You Can't Get Pregnant While Breastfeeding," A little pregnancy-prevention preoccupied bird might have told you that if you’re  breastfeeding  , it’s basically impossible to get pregnant even if you have sex without protection. It makes sense—if you recently had a child, your body should do its due diligence and set up a natural baby-proofing mechanism so you don’t accidentally wind up with way more than you bargained for. But that logic isn’t as simple as it seems. 
 “It’s true and not true,”  Jamil Abdur-Rahman  , M.D., board-certified ob/gyn and chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Vista East Medical Center in Waukegan, Illinois, tells SELF. Yes, the very act of breastfeeding suppresses ovulation, he explains. Namely, prolactin, the hormone that stimulates breast milk production, inhibits the FSH hormone that triggers your  ovarian follicles   to release eggs, he explains. Without an egg available for fertilization, you can't get pregnant, which is aces when you're still adjusting to new motherhood. 
 But the general thinking is that this only applies to people who are strictly  breastfeeding  , not those supplementing with other forms of nutrition for their babies. “When you’re only breastfeeding, your body is getting that constant hormonal feedback,” Sarah Yamaguchi, M.D., ob/gyn at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, tells SELF. It’s like with birth control pills, she explains: Protection works best when there’s a consistent stream of ovulation-preventing hormones in action. When you  miss birth control pills  , you're more liable to get pregnant, and your body interprets on-and-off breastfeeding in a similar way, she says. 
 There’s no concrete rule about how often you need to breastfeed for this protection to kick in. However, most people who breastfeed frequently, around every four hours during the day and every six hours at night, don’t ovulate and won’t get pregnant, Abdur-Rahman says. 
 But even if that is true for you, it isn’t even in effect for a full year, the experts caution. “If it’s been more than six months postpartum, most people start ovulating again,” Abdur-Rahman says. You might also start ovulating before that but not realize it, which can lead to an accidental pregnancy, Yamaguchi adds. There's this idea that you'll realize you're ovulating because you'll get your  period  , but that's not how the menstrual cycle works. Once you start ovulating again, an ovary will release an egg,  then   if there's nothing to fertilize, you'll get your first real postpartum period. “When you have that first ovulation, you have no clue,” Yamaguchi says. So, when you factor in that you’re supposed to wait six to eight weeks after giving birth to have sex again, you only have about four months to enjoy the sex-with-less-chance-of-pregnancy phenomenon. 
 There are ways to keep tabs on whether you might be at risk of getting pregnant while breastfeeding, like using ovulation kits,  monitoring your temperature  , which usually gets higher when you ovulate, or checking your cervical mucus, which tends to get thinner at that time of the month, Abdur-Rahman explains. Still, he says, ""it's dicey."" 
 Even if you're pretty sure you're not ovulating yet, neither expert thinks breastfeeding alone, even within the first six months, is adequate birth control if you’re having  sex   but don’t want to get pregnant. “If you’re exclusively breastfeeding and you really don’t want to be pregnant, definitely use something,” Yamaguchi says. 
 There are plenty of contraceptive options, although Yamaguchi cautions that ones with estrogen can affect milk supply and also put people at higher risk of blood clots for the first few months postpartum, and that IUDs placed in the months after childbirth have a slightly higher risk of  expulsion   (although it’s still small overall). A chat with your doctor will help you figure out which  birth control method   is your best postpartum bet.

Jerry Tomlin, who was diagnosed with a rare spinal condition called arteriovenous malformation resulting in him being paralyzed from the neck down, will travel to Chicago to see his son pitch Game 3 of the World Series.
In August, Jerry was informed by doctors that he may never walk again, and currently uses a wheelchair as mobility. He's been in the hospital and hasn't seen Josh since the time of the surgery, which was needed to save his life. Jerry was released last Wednesday, which happened to be his son's 32nd birthday, and the family decided it was time he witnessed Josh pitch in the most meaningful game of his child's life.
""It's neat because he's always talked about Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, two historical ballparks, being the ones he wants to go see,"" Josh told Anthony Castrovince of MLB.com.
""As a Father's Day gift, we let my father-in-law and him decide what game they wanted to see, and he was supposed to come to a game in Chicago (at U.S. Cellular Field). But because of the incident, he wasn't able to enjoy that gift. So it's nice to be able to share this with him.""
Josh, who struggled to pitch in the month of August with news of his father's condition (he posted an 11.48 ERA in six starts) has since battled back, posting a combined 1.98 ERA with 20 strikeouts and three walks since Sept. 5. For the first time since receiving the news that changed him and his father's life, Josh will have his dad there to cheer him on.

a5a22208,http://saintpetersblog.com/backers-release-intent-statement/,"Backers release ""intent"" statement for medical pot amendment","The team behind this year’s medical marijuana amendment has released an 11-page “intent” memo for voters to “understand the purposes” of the initiative.
“Voters should vote for an amendment fully understanding the intent of the drafters,” said the document, obtained by FloridaPolitics.com on Monday. “Fostering voter understanding is the central purpose of this memo, and we do so by expressing the intent of the individuals who drafted the language.”
The proposed change, which will be Amendment 2 on the November general election ballot, seeks to create a state constitutional right to medical cannabis in Florida. An internal poll recently showed 74 percent support; amendments need 60 percent approval to pass.
In 2014, a similar amendment fell two points short of adoption, despite many polls showing it would pass in the weeks leading up to the midterm elections. Law enforcement groups, many in the drug treatment community and several legislative leaders continue to oppose the initiative.
Generally, the 2016 amendment will allow people with debilitating medical conditions, as determined by a licensed Florida physician, to use medical marijuana. The amendment defines a debilitating condition as cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, and post-traumatic stress disorder, among others.
The memo was written by main amendment supporter and trial lawyer John Morgan, Dean Emeritus of the University of Florida law school Jon Mills, Drug Policy Alliance legal director Tamar Todd and Amendment 2 campaign director Ben Pollara.
The format of the memo is annotative, further explaining the proposed language, including “the limitations of this amendment.”
For instance, the analysis says the amendment “does not affect the current statutory prohibition on the operation of a vehicle, aircraft, train or boat while under the influence of marijuana. The legislature may pass additional laws regarding operating motor vehicles under the influence” of medicinal marijuana.
It “does not change federal law, under which marijuana is currently prohibited, but which the Justice Department has stated it does not intend to devote resources to prosecute marijuana use complying with state medical marijuana states in most cases.”
The amendment “does not require that the smoking of medical marijuana be allowed in public, … in schools, corrections institutions, detention facilities, and places of employment.”
The memo says “no insurance provider or government agency will be required to pay for expenses related to the use of medical marijuana,” and a “doctor remains potentially liable for other ethics violations or malpractice committed while treating a qualifying patient.”
“This Amendment does not require or need any legislative implementation to take effect,” the document says. “However, the Legislature may pass laws that further the intent and purposes of this amendment, and the Legislature may pass laws that otherwise expand access to marijuana. The Legislature may not pass laws that would be contrary to the purpose or nullify this Amendment.”

Bad news: Hackers sold that weapon.,"Good news: We know what caused Friday's web outage. Bad news: Hackers sold that weapon.by Circa News Privacy
WATCH | We contacted a computer science expert to explain how, without stealing a single password or implanting any kind of computer virus, cyber attackers can take down popular websites using the DDoS method.
Here's what happened
Remember when basically all your favorite sites went down on Friday? A security company found out just how hackers did it.
The bad news is, there's good reason to expect more outages. Hackers sold access to a ""botnet,"" a ring of connected devices controlled for nefarious purposes, earlier this month, according to Forbes. That botnet is believed to be the one responsible for the widespread outages that attacked DNS hosting service Dyn. The seller claimed it could generate 1 terabit of traffic for $12,100.
Should I be worried?
Probably. A spokesman for RSA, the security firm that discovered the sale, called the technology a ""worrying trend"" in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The fact that it's for sale means it could be used again, or even made more dangerous. 
How does it work?
Basically, any DDoS attack works by flooding a site with massive amounts of data so its servers can't handle the weight. Usually, multiple hacked computers (""bots"") are looped into a ""botnet"" under a hacker's control to generate the necessary traffic. 
But in Friday's attack, it wasn't just computers doing the damage. ""Internet of Things"" devices like DVRs and web cameras also contributed, Forbes reports. In some cases, the device's username and password were both ""root.""
How can we prevent this?
Well, as a user, there's not much to be done -- aside from making your passwords more complex. But tech companies can increase security on their end by actually using complex passwords, or use a backup DNS provider so if Dyn goes down, it doesn't take half the Internet with it.

Before the wedding, the spurned lover allegedly asked the bride to be in a relationship with him. Instead, she refused and argued that she wanted to start a new life, become a mother and raise a family. Unable to take the rejection, her ex-lover released the pictures to the groom, transporting them secretly through a bouquet of flowers.
The unidentified couple was celebrating their vows at a hotel when the groom opened the contents of the device. He then decided to divorce his wife on the spot, according to religious preacher Sheikh Ghazi Bin Abdul Aziz al-Shammari.
“The groom came to see me the next day and he was under strong emotional trauma,” Sheikh al-Shammari said. “It was truly the shock of his life and he could not bear the scandal.”
Sheikh al-Shammari did not reveal the nationalities of the bride and groom or the location of the event.
Last April, a bride also filed for divorce on her wedding night after finding out that her husband had lost nearly $300,000 in the stock market. The shock of losing his wife, home and fortune in the same night was so severe that he was taken to a hospital for treatment.

96bbc0a1,http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/10/judges-bails-on-suit-against-clinton-over-benghazi-deaths-229965,Judge bails on suit against Clinton over Benghazi deaths,"A federal judge with a long history of sharp criticism of President Bill Clinton's administration and some of his senior aides has bowed out of handling a wrongful death lawsuit filed against Hillary Clinton by the parents of two Americans killed in the 2012 attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi.
Patricia Smith, the mother of State Department information officer Sean Smith, and Charles Woods, the father of CIA operative Tyrone Woods, filed the case in federal court in Washington in August. The suit — brought by conservative attorney and longtime Clinton nemesis Larry Klayman — claimed that Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state compromised sensitive information about U.S. operations in Benghazi and led to the deaths of four Americans, including the younger Smith and Woods.
When the suit was filed, Klayman designated it as related to a Freedom of Information Act case filed in 2014 seeking records about Obama administration talking points related to the Benghazi attacks.
The designation guaranteed that the new suit would be assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth, who handled the talking points suit and a series of lawsuits against the Clinton administration in the 1990s.
In one, Lamberth ruled that the health care reform task force headed by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton was subject to a federal law requiring open meetings and public access to records. (An appeals court later reversed the core of that decision.) The Reagan appointee was also harshly critical of the Clinton administration and its personnel in high-profile cases involving FBI security files the Clinton White House hung on to about George H.W. Bush administration staffers and involving the alleged sale to campaign donors of slots on Commerce Department trade missions.
Without citing that history which must be well known to the judge and both sides, lawyers for Hillary Clinton last month formally protested Klayman's effort to direct the new suit to Lamberth.
""Because these cases have almost nothing in common, there is no basis for departure from the general rule of random assignment,"" Clinton's lawyers wrote. ""These two cases do not present common issues of fact.""
Clinton's legal team also said Klayman had a pattern of trying to route his cases to particular judges.
""Klayman has repeatedly abused this court’s related-case procedures. Counsel has frequently tried to funnel his cases to certain district court judges by strategically claiming that his cases are 'related' to other pending cases,"" wrote the Clinton lawyers, headed by longtime Clinton attorney David Kendall of Williams & Connolly.
On Tuesday, Lamberth sided with Clinton, throwing the wrongful death case back into the electronic hopper for reassignment. He did not explain his decision deeming the cases unrelated.
The Benghazi victims' parents' suit was then randomly placed on the docket of U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, an Obama appointee.

""Absent overwhelming evidence that there is, it would not be for me to say that there is,"" Conway said of voter fraud.

She added: ""Donald Trump is reading reports about rigged systems - voter irregularities.""

But when pressed about specific instances of voter fraud, Conway appeared to suggest that the ""rigged"" system was not meant to be taken literally, and was simply a rhetorical catch-all for what the campaign views as injustices in the American political system.

""I think everyone is missing his larger point,"" Conway said.

""It is a rigged, corrupt system, whether you believe it's rigged and corrupt at the polls or whether you believe it's rigged and corrupt in that we have a $19 trillion debt and people who are there for years and years, if not decades,"" she added.

Over the past week, Trump and many of his top campaign surrogates have increasingly made the unfounded case that there is a widespread conspiracy to ""rig"" the election against Trump.

""Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning. ""Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!""

A number of prominent Republicans in charge of overseeing the election at the state level have criticized Trump's inflammatory claim.

Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican supporting Trump, said on CNN on Monday that the US election system is ""one of the bedrocks of American democracy"" and added that ""we should not question it or the legitimacy of it.""

""It works very well in places like Ohio,"" he said. ""We make it easy to vote and hard to cheat. We have a bipartisan system of elections. Frankly, it's the only place you can find Republicans and Democrats working cooperatively together. They work that way in our election system to make sure the integrity of our election system is upheld and that people feel good about the process of voting.""","voter,republican,trump,campaign,conwai,fraud,unfound,conspiraci,widespread,elect"

For you, any dog photos posted by your friends are an automatic “like”.

In fact, almost everything you look at online is dogs.

But the worst part is that it seems like the internet only exists to break your heart, leaving you in a constant state of suffering since you don’t have a dog.

Science needs to invent a way to send virtual hugs to dogs over the internet.

Aside from following them online, you even PHYSICALLY follow dogs - and their owners - on the street, until you can “coincidentally” stop for a pet (of the dog).

And in most cases, you totally forget to acknowledge the owner.

You stop to “chat” with every dog you find waiting for their owners in front of the supermarket, imagining for a few wonderful moments that you are their human.

When talking to a dog owner, you’ve got tons of thoughts and a lot to say, offering advice and criticisms… until they ask what kind of dog you have.

Whenever you go to animal adoption fairs, you need to be dragged away by force.

And if they let you hold one of the puppies, you end up having an emotional breakdown.

Deep down, you know that the best moment of your day would be so much better if you had a dog.

You know exactly how these people feel.

In fact, you may even be one of them.

You spend a lot of time thinking about how you could change a few things around in your life to make room for your very own furry little friend.

You know in your heart that a dog will help you be a better, more responsible person.

A life with a dog in it is a happier life.

And in the meantime, you drop little hints to your roomies - or your family - about how you’re responsible enough for a dog. (Which never works.)

You’ve even thought about trying the “but he just followed me all the way here!” line before.

And to fill your need, you just visit your friends with dogs way more often than visit your friends who do not have dogs.

Trump wore Gucci’s bright pink pussybow blouse at the last debate, shortly after her husband’s infamous “bus tape” release, in which the Republican nominee employed the P-word like it was going out of fashion. With tonight’s all-black Ralph Lauren Collection ensemble, Trump was making a bold and pointed statement, committing to the pussybow look and all the obvious connotations with gusto.
Trump chose to accessorize her jumpsuit with a wide patent belt and Alexander McQueen clutch. It was a more somber look than the outfits we’ve seen her in thus far, and certainly a far cry and from the sparkling white Roksanda Ilincic dress she sported at the Republican convention. Though the knot of her pussybow was clearly far more deconstructed than the neatly tied one she flaunted at the last debate, the message was still loud and clear.

99d1982e,http://www.littlethings.com/girl-has-cyst-with-teeth/,"Doctors Ignore Young Lady's Pain For Years, Then Discover It's Her Twin","Sometimes, as women, it can be uncomfortable for us to talk about our bodies, especially when it comes to health problems.

Long-standing stigmas against women’s health topics have made us squeamish about sharing them, or questioning when we want to know more about them.

But fortunately, more and more woman are coming forward with stories, personal accounts, and pictures related to their health, like this woman with PCOS bravely did.

Another woman who wasn’t afraid to speak up for the sake of her body was Natashjja Heming, who was constantly confused about the pelvic pain that plagued her all throughout her teens.

Initially doctors told her that nothing serious was causing the straining feeling, but she wasn’t convinced and eventually found another specialist who would run more tests.

Once an ultrasound was conducted, a huge menacing cyst was discovered, which confirmed her fears that something was wrong.

Check below to learn more about this intriguing medical mystery — it will definitely empower you to speak up for your health’s sake!

Since age 13, Natashjja Heming can remember feeling a “pulling,” cloying pain on the left side of her pelvic region.

She and her mother thought that it could be due to endometriosis and tried to get her diagnosed, but doctors couldn’t detect anything wrong and advised her to continue to take pain medication instead.

But the pain persisted throughout high school and beyond.

Heming suffered silently through it, all the while wondering exactly why the pain felt so severe.

By the time she turned 22, she had had enough of the constant discomfort and switched to a new doctor.

This time, the doctor agreed to begin the exploratory process with an ultrasound.

Almost immediately, the doctor discovered an abnormality and called other specialists into the room to see it.

It turns out that Heming was not overthinking the pain; she actually had a cyst the size of a peach wrapped around her fallopian tube!

The cyst was identified as a dermoid cyst, which had likely been inside her since birth.

Within the cyst, doctors detected hair, three teeth, spinal fluid, and skin tissue.

Some theorize that these cysts develop when one twin absorbs another in utero — and since twins happen to run in Heming’s family, she joked that she must have eaten her twin in the womb.

After receiving the diagnosis, she felt relieved that the suspicion for her pain hadn’t all been in her head.

But the doctors told her that the cyst would grow to the size of a mango if it was not taken care of.

During the difficult procedure, the cyst burst, resulting in a painful, but ultimately successful recovery.

Since her ordeal, Heming has been a very vocal advocate for girls to speak up if they are feeling unsure about what is going on in their bodies.

Regardless of what medical professionals may urge, you should never feel uncomfortable about pressing issues that have to do with your health, or getting a second opinion on a diagnosis!

If you believe that all patients should be adamant and vocal about their health, make sure to SHARE with friends and family on Facebook.

They’re suggesting he should be removed as Republican presidential candidate after his worst controversy yet.

Utah senator Mike Lee did it. Illinois senator Mark Kirk did it. Nevada representative Joe Heck did it. And now, former GOP primary candidate Carly Fiorina has done it.

Donald Trump does not represent me or my party. I understand the responsibility of Republicans to support their nominee….

The names, high-profile or not, go on and on.

You get the point: People are talking about it.

And you know what the craziest thing about that is? Technically — and we do stress technically — it is not impossible.

There is a provision made for the replacement of a candidate, and that provision, within the Republican party’s rules, is known as Rule 9.

According to the Washington Post, it reads,

The Republican National Committee is hereby authorized and empowered to fill any and all vacancies which may occur by reason of death, declination, or otherwise of the Republican candidate for President of the United States or the Republican candidate for Vice President of the United States, as nominated by the national convention, or the Republican National Committee may reconvene the national convention for the purpose of filling any such vacancies.

The “otherwise,” as one expert explains to the Post, is not meant to cover an instance of “we don’t like this guy anymore.”

But here we are, in 2016, and a New York Times writer is reporting that Republican officials are discussing the possibility.

Source tells me RNC officials are meeting in DC to discuss what options the party has going forward in case Trump isn't nominee.

Now, just so we’re clear, it looks totally unlikely that Trump will be removed as a candidate.

First off, thousands of votes have already been cast in this election via early voting in some states. Secondly, the rule seems pretty clearly intended to facilitate the replacement of a candidate, not the actual removal. Third, Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Saturday that there’s “zero chance” of him stepping down.

As one RNC member said, “We are stuck and so is Pence.”

So, while in theory the idea of a different presidential candidate being chosen is a possibility, the actual circumstances before us makes it look pretty much implausible (if not impossible).

And that’s probably a good thing because this election has already been enough of a circus.

Here's what Donald 'Pussy-Grabbing' Trump's running mate thinks about women…

For months, Donald Trump has been promising to be tough on the Islamic State and has criticized the Obama administration for not taking the fight to the terrorists. Now that the battle of Mosul is underway, Trump has become a cheerleader for the failure of the mission while promoting a conspiracy theory that it’s all about him.
On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the ongoing Iraqi-led offensive against the Islamic State’s stronghold in Mosul was failing:
The attack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster. We gave them months of notice. U.S. is looking so dumb. VOTE TRUMP and WIN AGAIN!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2016
Monday morning, in an interview with Pat Robertson on “The 700 Club,” Trump doubled down on his prediction that the U.S. and allied coalition in Mosul will fail. He repeated his claim that tens of thousands of Iraqi, Kurdish and allied forces should have done a “sneak attack,” on Mosul, which is obviously impossible given the size of the mission and the nature of the battlefield there.
“You see what’s going on. You see how badly that fight is going,” Trump said. “If you want to go into Mosul, you don’t tell people for four months. Now they are having a hard time and they are really dug in, and the people that we wanted, the leaders of ISIS, are gone.
Trump’s Sunday tweet and Monday comments follow a string of incorrect statements by the GOP candidate about what’s happening on the ground in Mosul, several of which were made at last week’s presidential debate.
On the campaign trail, Trump has said repeatedly that the Obama administration began the assault on Mosul “because Obama wanted to show what a tough guy he is before the election,” and because the administration wanted to help Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. That’s clearly erroneous because the mission is Iraqi-led and the Iraqi government controlled the timing.
But Trump’s latest claims, that the mission in Mosul “is a total disaster,” is not just wrong; he is actually rooting for the failure of a battle where hundreds of U.S. troops are in harm’s way and where a U.S. soldier gave his life only days ago.
Trump’s statements on how he would combat the Islamic State have been all over the map. At various times he has said his plans are “secret,” endorsed the torture of suspected terrorists, pledged to kill their families and promised to “take the oil,” which makes no sense at all. The one consistent Trump claim is that he would “knock the hell out of ISIS.” Now he is criticizing the anti-Islamic State coalition for doing just that.
The battle in Mosul is messy, progress is slow, and the fighting will continue for weeks at least, but is it not a “total disaster” and no American leader should push that line. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter visited the nearby city of Irbil over the weekend and spoke in support of the U.S. soldiers participating in the mission.
“Let me begin by saying what magnificent work our troops are doing here. I had a chance to talk with them about their work, tell them of our support for their work here. I can’t describe all of that, but it was all done with the excellence you would expect of our forces and this is a mission that is necessary to protect our people,” Carter said. “So there are people out here taking risks every day, but they’re doing that because it’s necessary to defend our country.”
That’s how a leader speaks about an ongoing operation. Predicting failure of U.S. forces in battle is not only defeatist and counterproductive, it’s akin to trumpeting the propaganda line of the Islamic State itself. In short, it’s the opposite of what someone who wants to be commander in chief should do.

fb252194,http://www.rd.com/health/conditions/thyroid-health/,7 Little Healthy Habits That Make Your Thyroid Happy,"iStock/gilaxia
Many patients don’t know much about thyroid basics, says Alan P. Farwell, MD, chief of the section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Nutrition, and director of endocrine clinics at Boston Medical Center. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the neck that controls your metabolism. Generally, an overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism) could make you feel anxious, shaky, sweaty, and hot, and cause weight loss and trouble sleeping among other symptoms. Conversely, a person with an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism) might feel sluggish, fatigued, and cold, and could experience problems including weight gain and constipation. While lifestyle habits like daily diet and activity don’t have much impact on thyroid health, there are a number of things you can do to make sure your thyroid stays healthy. These are silent symptoms of a thyroid problem.
Find out your family history

“If your family members—mom, dad, siblings—have thyroid disease, you’re much more likely to experience thyroid dysfunction yourself,” says Leonard Wartofsky, MD, MACP, professor of medicine at Georgetown University and past president of the Endocrine Society. For anyone with a family history, it’s especially important to have your thyroid monitored. In an annual physical, for example, your physician will examine your thyroid by touching the neck to feel for a goiter, enlarged thyroid, or nodules. These are symptoms of thyroid cancer you shouldn’t ignore.
Get checked

In addition to the physical exam, if you suspect you may have a thyroid problem—due to either family history or a range of symptoms—ask your doctor about a blood test to check your levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Although it sounds backward, a high TSH result indicates thyroid levels that are too low, and a low TSH result indicates thyroid levels that are too high, Dr. Wartofsky explains. If your thyroid levels are off, your doctor will talk to you about treatment options. For hypothyroidism, the approach is to increase thyroid by taking an oral synthetic thyroid hormone; for hyperthyroidism, the approach is to block thyroid overproduction with a drug, radioactive iodine treatment, or surgery.
Pregnant? Supplement your iodine intake

The thyroid needs adequate iodine to stay healthy, and in the United States we normally get that iodine through our salt, bread, and other foods. “But the one group that sometimes doesn’t get enough iodine is pregnant women because they need extra to ensure that both their thyroid and the baby’s thyroid are normal,” says Michael Tuttle, MD, clinical director of the Endocrinology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “It’s therefore important that pregnant women get multivitamins that contain iodine.”
But don’t OD on iodine

For everyone else, whether you tend toward the low or high end of thyroid function, too much iodine isn’t necessary, says Dr. Wartofsky. “It’s very common to read in self-help books and diet books that iodine is good for the thyroid, and people will go out and buy rich iodine sources like kelp tablets, and that can be dangerous,” he explains. “So it’s important not to exceed a normal intake of iodine.”
Don’t fear cruciferous veggies
iStock/DNY59
One piece of misinformation Dr. Tuttle often hears is that patients are afraid to eat too many cruciferous vegetables, such as kale and cabbage, because they’ve heard such greens can cause the thyroid to develop a goiter. “It’s true but only if you eat a truckload of the stuff,” he says. “We don’t want people avoiding vegetables; we want people to have a normal diet and not worry about those sorts of things bothering the thyroid.” These superfood veggies could be the next kale.
If you take thyroid medication, stay vigilant

“Once you get diagnosed with a thyroid condition and put on pills, you’re not done,” says Dr. Tuttle. “It’s a lifelong thing to keep on your radar screen.” Not only do pills need to be taken daily following doctors orders (for example, don’t mix them with vitamins, because iron or calcium could interfere with absorption), but over the years your thyroid levels should be regularly tested to determine if dosages need to be adjusted. “It can be easy to get sloppy and miss a pill or miss a set of blood tests and not see the doctor once a year, so make sure you keep up with it,” Dr. Tuttle urges.

Judge Jeanine Pirro claims that if she was still a district attorney, she would go forward with indictment “in three seconds” of the purported Democrat operatives who allegedly incited violence at GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump rallies.
A vocal Trump supporter and Hillary Clinton/Barack Obama foe, Pirro is known for her fiery “opening statements” each week on Justice with Judge Jeanine on the Fox News Channel. This declaration came, however, on Fox & Friends in a debate with FNC colleague Gerald Rivera who seemed to try to downplay the hidden-camera videos released by muckraker James O’Keefe and his Project Veritas organization.
The O’Keefe video about purported Democrat operatives allegedly inciting violence at Trump rallies has received nearly six million YouTube hits so far, while another of his videos showing operatives allegedly boasting about committing mass voter fraud has about 3.5 million views. The videos have prompted several resignations from DNC-aligned groups so far along with complaints to the Federal Elections Commission and a possible Trump lawsuit against Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.
O’Keefe has also uploaded a short video in which another purported operative allegedly plans to bully women at Trump rallies. The conservative filmmaker has promised to release more explosive videos, perhaps as early as today..
Earlier this month, Twitter suspended O’Keefe’s account after he published two undercover videos: In one of them, New York City elections official, a Democrat, seems to acknowledge widespread voter fraud or potential fraud in the Big Apple, in part facilitated by Mayor Bill de Blasio’s distributing of so-called municipal ID cards without any vetting.
In a second video, a purported Hillary Clinton staffer allegedly talks about having to grab a co-worker’s “a**” twice in order to be fired from the campaign. On the same video, a different Clinton staffer allegedly seems to be okay with trashing voter registration forms if a person seeks to register as a Republican rather than a Democrat. Shortly thereafter, Twitter locked O’Keefe’s account, but he has been reinstated after deleting a tweet about the latter video which he believes is the social network’s way of covering itself after many users complained about his suspension.

— Jeanine Pirro (@JudgeJeanine) October 21, 2016
On Fox & Friends, Judge Jeanine declared that local law enforcement authorities should pursue an indictment against any Democrat operative allegedly involved in Trump rally violence, which is apparently called “bird-dogging.”
“First of all, you and I know that Loretta Lynch and the Justice Department would be there in three seconds if it were reversed, if they’re were Democrats who were being…victimized according to them. But you know what—people can say ‘where’s the FBI, where’s the Justice Department, it’s a violation of civil rights and all that,’ but you know what, as a former prosecutor, I would put a criminal case together without the FBI, without the Justice Department, because they’re clearly the most politicized Justice Department in the history of this country…whether it’s tied to the White House or not is for the feds…I can indict them. Don’t wait for the feds; they ain’t coming.”
Geraldo had a different perspective on the footage. “Rivera said he still questions that the ‘braggadocio’ seen on the tape could be made into a specific criminal charge by a prosecutor,” Fox News Insider noted.
.@JudgeJeanine: I could indict the operatives who were caught on tape talking about inciting violence at Trump rallies in three seconds pic.twitter.com/LGkk1UHDcB
— FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) October 21, 2016
Judge Jeanine quickly rejected that rationalization.
“I’m talking about crime, I’m talking about justice in this country. I’m talking about people who decide…that what they’re going to do is incite riots and incite violence. That is against the law in the United States of America…I could indict them in three seconds.”
Watch the entire FNC segment with Judge Jeanine Pirro and Celebrity Apprentice runner-up Gerald Rivera where they debate the impact and the legal implications of the James O’Keefe videos as well as commenting on the Al Smith Dinner which featured speeches by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

Let's meet today's contestants. Tom Hanks played a Donald Trump supporter (Make America Great Again hat and all) during a Black Jeopardy sketch on Saturday Night Live on Saturday, October 22.

The Sully actor, 60, who also hosted the episode, portrayed Doug, a stereotyped Trump voter clad in a denim jacket, a bald eagle T-shirt and a red baseball cap emblazoned with the Republican presidential candidate's campaign slogan.

During the skit, Doug does fairly well in the ""Big Girls"" and ""White People"" categories, pleasantly surprising fellow contestants Shanice (Leslie Jones) and Keeley (Sasheer Zamata), as well as host Darnell Hayes (Kenan Thompson).

""They told me a fella can win some money, so let's win me some money,"" Doug told Darnell at the beginning of the game, adding, ""Get 'er done!""

But everything suddenly came crashing down as Darnell introduced the Final Jeopardy category: ""Lives That Matter.""

""Well, it was good while it lasted, Doug,"" the host said with a chuckle as Doug's big smile immediately went grim.

""I got a lot to say about this,"" he replied, as Darnell said, ""I'm sure you do. When we come back [from commercial break], we'll play the national anthem and just see what the hell happens!""

A 12-year-old student in Tampa claims he was scolded by his teacher when he did not stand up for the Pledge of Allegiance. 
“I don’t believe in standing up for it because there’s more than one religion,” sixth grader Mark Dawson said to WFLA. “I believe in more than one religion and more than one nation.""
Dawson attends Liberty Middle School in Hillsborough County, where the school district's policy states that students do not have to take part in the act, ""as long as they don't get in the way of other students who want to say it,"" WFLA reports. 
Dawson said to WFLA that after his teacher yelled at him, she then told him to leave the classroom. A school spokesperson said to WFLA that the teacher ""was in the wrong"" and allegedly did not know about the school policy. 
Dawson's family members told WFLA they might sue the school district for infringing on the boy's rights, according to WFLA.

But if I could become a virgin again from lack of anything remotely sexual for years I would be a virgin. DH refuses to have sex ever again. He's always had a very low sex drive. Even when we were first engaged we only had sex once a week if I was lucky. After marriage there was no sex after the honeymoon until he wanted a baby. It was the worst sex of my life. I would cry in the bathroom afterwards. I felt disgusting. He could only touch me to procreate and it was so quick and unromantic. I got pregnant right away. That was the last time I had sex. That was 3 years ago. He doesn't touch me. We don't make out. He gives me a peck when he leaves. That's the only romantic affection I ever get. I've begged and pleaded. I've suggested couples therapy or going to therapy on our own for years. He just tells me that he doesn't believe in therapy and he doesn't want to ever have sex again or discuss it ever again. Other than sex and his refusal for therapy we are mostly happy. But I don't want to never have sex again. I'm only 25. Besides I make sacrifices all the time for him and I'm starting to resent him and we are becoming more and more distant. Why is he doing this to me? What am I supposed to do?
 As long as you allow this behavior, he'll continue. As the other ladies have suggested you have a few options. 
 Leave because it's emotional abuse and neglect.
 Have an affair because you do have needs that need to be met in order for you to be a good mother and wife. 
 Get a divorce and go find happiness. 
 I guess so. But he has 2 children with his ex wife. So I keep thinking it's something he doesn't like about me. I've threatened him with divorce and he leaves and stays at his friends house for the night. Then he comes back the next day and pretends we never even fought. If I say anything to him about talking it out he threatens to leave me. It doesn't get anywhere. 
Quoting Anonymous 4: Is it possible that he is asexual?
 Have a Serious conversation and make therapy an ultimatum. You are very young and the relationship will get very nasty quick without a solution. 
 It's very possible that he could have a medical reason behind his low sex drive. I do. I have a sleep disorder and my neurotransmitters are completely screwed up and it seriously affects my sex drive. I could not care any less if I never had sex again and besides how much my husband enjoys it, I wouldn't mind saying the same thing....no more sex. I can't force or fake it either. 
 However, the way he is just flat out refusing it says that there is something more- whether it's medical and something emotional or just emotional. His refusal to discuss it is a red flag, but men are more hesitant to talk about those issues than women are. Honestly, I'm not sure what you cn do until he is willing to be open. 
No, no I would not.
Quoting craazycuckoo: 
Because of lack of sex? 
If this was the other way around you'd be telling her husband to stop being such a fucking baby and take care of it with his hand and porn.
OP, get a dildo, go watch some porn and get over yourself. 
 Women are always jumping to divorce about every tiny little thing. It's pretty sad.

 It's not even the lack of sex. It's that she's got needs and he doesn't seem to care. That's aggravating. If it were the other way around there would be some saying give it to him or he'll go elsewhere. But he's ignoring her.. what's she to do have an affair? 
Quoting craazycuckoo: 
So, to fix missing a person, you're thinking of divorce? That makes a lot of sense.
If talking to him has turned up nothing. And I mean talking, not accusing, yelling, screaming, or freaking out like these women do, then it's time to suggest therapy or something.
But divorce is so fucking dense it's mind boggling. 
Quoting Anonymous 1: Get over myself??? I'm a human being. We are sexual beings. I'm not saying I need it 10 times a day because I'm horny. I miss having a romantic physical relationship with the man I love.

2b0f50ee,http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/trump-hotels-getting-beat-trump-campaign-n670266,"With Empty Rooms and Bookings Plummeting, Trump Hotels Are Taking a Beating","Donald Trump may already be calling for a recount of votes in what he claims will be a rigged election — but he may also want to recount the empty rooms at his hotels.

The Republican presidential nominee's actions out on the campaign trail don't seem to be doing much for occupancy rates at his chain of five-star Trump-branded hotels.

While the Los Angeles Dodgers stayed at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago this past May, its Mexican-American first baseman Adrian Gonzalez would not.

""I had my reasons,"" is all Gonzalez would say about the lodging choices, but at least one newspaper linked the choice to Trump's anti-Mexican campaign statements.

Bookings at the newly opened Trump International Hotel, Washington, D.C. on Pennsylvania Avenue also seem to be bearing the brunt of this contentious election cycle.

When it had its soft opening in September, rack rates for the basic 410-square ""deluxe"" rooms started at over $575 a night.

Checking the hotel's online booking site, that same room type is now available for an unrestricted rate of $505, with a discount to $404 for AAA members, for at least the next two weekends and for the weekend after the presidential election.

By comparison, when searching Expedia for a five-star hotel in Washington, D.C., next weekend, a room at the St. Regis Washington, D.C. is available for $655 a night, while the Hay-Adams and others show as sold out.

The Trump family plans an official ribbon-cutting and press conference for the D.C. hotel on October 26, but for now, it's the falling room rates that are getting noticed.

Despite its prime location and promotional mentions by Donald Trump himself, ""empty rooms have forced hotel to reduce rates during the peak season,"" noted New York Magazine.

But Mickael Damelincourt, the hotel's managing director, disagreed with this characterization, telling NBC News ""the opening of Trump International Hotel, Washington, D.C., has been the most successful in terms of opening bookings, interest from groups and large events.""

Nevertheless, according to travel site Hipmunk, bookings for Trump-branded hotels in New York, Las Vegas, and Chicago continue to plummet, down more than 58 percent during the first half of 2016 as compared to the first half of 2015.

""While the Trump name is a powerful brand name, it may also carry some negative connotation with travelers from around the world,"" noted Keven Murphy, chair of the Hospitality Services Department, at Rosen College of Hospitality Management in Orlando.

Perhaps that's why Trump's newest hotel line, announced last month, won't bear his name at all: The Trump Organization has dropped the name completely, going for Scion, which means ""descendant of a notable family,"" the company's news release explained.

Wow !!! Trump won't put his name on new hotels. Even he knows his brand is over. Say goodnight Donnie. https://t.co/ue9erP8Dnh

The name is ""a nod to the Trump family and to the tremendous success it has had with its businesses,"" said Trump Hotels Chief Executive Officer Eric Danziger, in a statement.

Make sense, says Murphy of Rosen College: ""With the advent of the shared economy and the rise of the purchasing power of the Millennial generation, hotel strategies have changed and this may be the reason for the new Scion name.""","trump,recount,hotel,intern hotel,rate,washington,gonzalez,empti,trumpbrand,book"

But in the short-term, you’ll have to pardon them if they don’t want to go to Oakland anyway.
The Raiders cruised to an easy 33-16 win over the Jaguars Sunday, improving them to 5-2 on the season.
The win was the fourth straight on the road for the Raiders this season, which is great news considering they stay in Florida to play the Buccaneers next week. They’re camping out in Sarasota this week rather than going back west, and they’re doing so with an easy win in their pocket.
Latavius Murray ran for two touchdowns and their defense forced three turnovers, more than enough on a day when the Jaguars kind of rolled over.
The Jaguars had a number of problems, but lost defensive tackle Roy Miller to an Achilles injury, and he did not return.
That left them short in the middle, when defensive tackle Malik Jackson was ejected in the fourth quarter after his second unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Cornerback Jalen Ramsey was also ejected (along with Raiders wideout Johnny Holton) after a late-game fight borne out of frustration.
And on a day when their offense couldn’t do a thing, those losses were more metaphorical than a reason the Jaguars lost to fall to 2-4.
Blake Bortles was 23-of-43 for 246 yards and a touchdown and two interceptions. And aside for a 42-yard gallop by Chris Ivory, the Jaguars only added 63 yards on their other 15 rushing attempts.
The game also featured a season-high 239 penalty yards, as referee Jeff Triplette got more screen time than either presidential candidate.

13121f58,http://www.livescience.com/56590-snake-bites-kids.html,Venomous Snake Bites on the Rise in Kids,"Credit: makasana photo/Shutterstock.com
 More than 1,300 kids are bitten by snakes each year in the U.S. — and an increasing number of these bites come from the venomous copperhead snake (Agkistrodon contortrix), a new study finds.
 In addition, bites from unknown venomous snakes have also increased since 2000, according to the study.
 Between 2000 and 2013, there were more than 18,000 reports of snakebites in children in the U.S., the researchers wrote in their study, which was published Oct. 20 in the journal Pediatrics. The majority of these bites occurred in males, and the average age of the kids who were bitten was 10.7 years old. While bites occurred in every month of the year, one-third of all bites took place in June and July, the study found. [The World's 6 Deadliest Snakes]
 About half the snakebites that were reported were from venomous snakes, according to the study. Copperhead snakes and rattlesnakes (genus Crotalus) accounted for 70 percent of all of the venomous bites, followed by bites from unknown species (20 percent). Bites from cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorus) accounted for 6 percent of bites, while 3 percent came from coral snakes and 1 percent came from exotic venomous snakes, the researchers found.
 Four children died from snakebites during the study period, the researchers found. In three of the cases, the snake was identified as a rattlesnake, and in one case the snake was unidentified, they found. 
 Encounters with exotic snakes have increased, according to the study. ""Fifty years ago, no exotic species were reported,"" by snakebite victims, the researchers wrote. In recent years, many of these exotic species are increasingly being kept as pets. With the growing popularity of these snakes, ""it is reasonable to expect that the calls to poison control centers about exotic snakes will become more common"" in the coming years, they wrote. 
 Although venomous snakebites were reported in every state in the continental U.S., as well as in Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, the majority occurred in the South and Southwestern U.S., according to the researchers, who were led by Dr. Joann Schulte, a public health physician and pediatrician at the North Texas Poison Center.
 Copperhead bites were most common in Texas and North Carolina: One-third of all the copperhead bites were recorded in these two states. Rattlesnake bites, on the other hand, were most common in Arizona and California, which reported 40 percent of all bites from these species. Bites from Coral snakes and cottonmouths were most common in Florida.
 The researchers noted that there can be significant variation in the effects that snakebites cause in children. For example, up to 20 percent of venomous snakebites are ""dry,"" meaning that no venom is injected during the bite. This occurs when a snake has used up all of its venom supply, according to the study.
 The amount of venom that is injected during a bite also varies, and the severity of the symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening, according to the study. On the extreme end of the spectrum, bites can lead to severe drops in blood pressure, an inability to think clearly, rapid heart rate and breathing, and bleeding problems.

425506b0,http://theresurgent.com/krauthammers-vote-the-answer-is/,Krauthammer’s Vote: The Answer Is…,"Charles Krauthammer is one of the most intellectually gifted, insightful, and, frankly, sane pundits in America. He is not prone to wild statements or straw man burning. Krauthammer disclosed who will get his vote for president in a New York Daily News piece Friday.
He correctly pegs Clinton as a soulless candidate whose sense of self-entitlement drives her insatiable quest for power.
The soullessness of this campaign — all ambition and entitlement — emerges almost poignantly in the emails, especially when aides keep asking what the campaign is about. In one largely overlooked passage, Clinton complains that her speechwriters have not given her any overall theme or rationale. Isn’t that the candidate’s job? Asked one of her aides, Joel Benenson: “Do we have any sense from her what she believes or wants her core message to be?”
Clinton has no “message” in the sense of how she would govern on behalf of American citizens. Her message is that she would govern America as a monarch rules a sovereignty. Citizens would be reduced to subjects under her imperious reign, because she deserves the throne. Her message is to not oppose her, or else. It’s not a core message as much as a national ultimatum.
I didn’t need the Wiki files to oppose Hillary Clinton. As a conservative, I have long disagreed with her worldview and the policies that flow from it. As for character, I have watched her long enough to find her deeply flawed, to the point of unfitness. But for those heretofore unpersuaded, the recent disclosures should close the case.
A case so strong that, against any of a dozen possible GOP candidates, voting for her opponent would be a no-brainer. Against Donald Trump, however, it’s a dilemma. I will not vote for Hillary Clinton. But, as I’ve explained in these columns, I could never vote for Donald Trump.
The Wikileaks files are an inevitable consequence of Hillary Clinton’s long career in building her own power and influence. Money is just lubricating oil to the Clintons. Receiving it and spending it merely move the pistons of real power. She would prefer to deal with despots and autocrats because they understand these things at an eye-to-eye level better than politicians. Clinton believes herself above being a politician, as she believes herself above the law.
To Trump, money is the object. Spending it is a head feint. Trump is the rich man from Fiddler on the Roof–Tevye’s fantasy, “And it won’t make one bit of difference if I answer right or wrong. When you’re rich they think you really know.” Being rich is Donald Trump. Being powerful is Hillary Clinton.
Neither is acceptable. Krauthammer wrote he is down to Paul Ryan or Ben Sasse as write-ins. They are good choices. Maybe he will, in the end, decide to vote for Evan McMullin, if only for the appearance of a unified write-in alternative. In any case, as Erick shared, the White House is already lost to Republicans.
As my brother wryly observed, we’re down to reading articles from NeverTrumpers and seeing who they are going to write in. Sad.

The email exchange was in 2014, before Clinton officially announced her candidacy and prior to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders entering the race and making concerns about income inequality and the concentration of wealth and power at the top a major theme of the Democratic primary election.
The messages are among thousands posted on the WikiLeaks website recently that are purported to have been hacked from Podesta’s inbox. The Clinton campaign has said little to confirm or deny the authenticity of the emails or their content.
The campaign's chief strategist, Joel Benenson, said today on ABC News' ""This Week"" that while he hasn't spent a lot of time reading the purportedly leaked emails, ""I know I've seen things that aren't authentic, that we know aren't authentic."" He declined to elaborate, saying he wouldn't ""go into details.""
Podesta released a statement that blamed the Russians for what he called ""the illegal hack”: “It is now clear that the illegal hack of my personal email account was —- just like the other recent, election-related hacks —- the work of the Russian government,"" the statement said.
The email exchange about the study suggesting the U.S. is now an oligarchy was -- if the messages are authentic -- between James Sandler and his father Herbert Sandler of The Sandler Foundation, both of whom have donated to Democratic causes or candidates.
James Sandler appears to have initiated the exchange with an email that linked to a story on the liberal blog Talking Points Memo about the study, with a headline declaring that the U.S. is no longer an actual democracy.
""I guess it takes a study to point out the obvious,"" Sandler purportedly wrote.
Podesta does not appear to comment on the study, instead referring to a New York Times op-ed about Israeli politics moving to the right.
""US is no longer a democracy"" ""Guess it takes a study to point out the obvious"" billionaire to Clinton chief https://t.co/szXz5clpuu pic.twitter.com/w4f33gFp5j
— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 22, 2016
Herbert Sandler responds that he has ""read it and circulated it,"" though it's unclear if he's referring to the Talking Points Memo article or the study itself.
He adds that this is precisely what he and his wife ""have believed for some time ... It is horrible.""
ABC News requested comment from the Sandler Foundation but did not immediately hear back.
In the , political scientists Martin Gilens of Princeton University and Benjamin I. Page of Northwestern University found that a small number of super wealthy people, the ""economic elites,"" and organized groups representing business interests in the U.S. have far greater influence on public policy than ""average citizens.""
""We believe that if policy-making is dominated by powerful business organizations and a small number of affluent Americans, then America's claims to being a democratic society are seriously threatened,"" the authors stated in the study.
Bernie Sanders made this theme a tenet of his primary campaign against Clinton.
""[W]e are moving rapidly away from our democratic heritage into an oligarchic form of society,"" Sanders said said in a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. in February 2015. ""Today, the most serious problem we face is the grotesque and growing level of wealth and income inequality. This a profound moral issue, this is an economic issue and this is a political issue.""
Sanders also sought in his campaign to portray Clinton as less focused on this issue and too concerned with the interests of Wall Street.

Once you think about it, this totally makes sense!
An article in the British tabloid SWNS.com describes the thirty-year of a pair of English swingers, Ian and Jean Smith, who have been ""partying"" together and with other people, in the swinging lifestyle of London since the 1970's.
They started having sex with other people only six months after their marriage and, by their count, have been to over three hundred play parties with other people.
The couple is now in their seventies — and they are still going strong. 
With four children, eight grandchildren, and a marriage that spans thirty years, it's hard to criticize the apparent health of their relationship (though I'm sure that some will).
My own literary and psychological explorations into the phenomenon of alternative sexual practices began when I met two different couples in my practice who lived what they called a ""hotwife"" lifestyle — one where the wives had sex with other men, with the husband's permission and encouragement. Distinct from the Smith's swinging lifestyle, the hotwife couples' practices don't include outside sex with other partners, unless it occurs in the confines of group sex centered around the wife.
I will share that I was floored by these couples' descriptions, as their practices so directly contradict the social programming males receive, which tells us we must jealously and violently guard and protect our mates' sexuality from other men.
The thing that was even more surprising to me was that both of the first couples I encountered were professional, educated and successful. And like the Smiths, they both had decades-long marriages.
One of the wives I met was a vice-president in a significant multinational corporation. The other was a tenured, well-published college professor.
And both of them loved to have sex with men other than their husbands, often while their husbands watched.
I spent the next two years interviewing couples around the country. My sample was not randomly chosen, I had no control groups, and my efforts were not intended as research, but merely as an investigation. I found many other couples like these and the Smiths, who had managed to find compatibility by stepping outside the social boundaries of marriage.
Again and again, these couples told me, ""If you can talk about this (having sex with other people), you can talk about anything.""
These couples' communication skills were extraordinary.
And, these couples' sexual practices were enormously empowering to the wives.
Women told me that while they knew their husband thought they were beautiful, being desired by other men was even more validating to them. After all, ""Your husband is supposed to think you're beautiful,"" they would say.
These couples had negotiated boundaries, both mutual and individual. They had described to each other their most base, deepest secrets and sexual desires.
Many of the couples I saw had previous divorces, and entered into this marriage accepting that monogamy was not a reasonable goal for them. They knew themselves well enough to say, ""This monogamy thing doesn't work for me"" — and as a result, were able to negotiate marriages from a place of self-acceptance and self-knowledge.
Nearly every one of these couples told me that after the wife had sex with other men, their own sex life was fueled, and the couple had sex the way they did when they first started dating.
I speculate that the fuel to this fire is in the neurochemistry and biology of sperm competition. These couples essentially subvert mechanisms ntended to prevent illicit pregnancies, co-opting our basic biological processes to serve a role in fanning the flames of relationships long past the time they might have normally subsided into a comfortable, quiet love, where sex is nice, but not necessary.
Are these types of relationships for everybody? Certainly not.
I encountered numerous couples who dipped their toes into these dangerous waters and yanked them out again, their marriages just barely surviving the flames of jealousy and fear.
But, in contrast to the portrayals of almost every such couple in the media, where couples like Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson in Indecent Proposal are doomed to destruction, many couples have found ways to make this work — and work incredibly well.
Can these couples teach others how to communicate, overcome jealousy, and support each other through complicated, challenging activities?
Can they teach us how to mutually support each others' growth and development, regardless of whether sex with others is involved?
I believe that rather than condemning these couples, we should be working to understand what it is in their relationships that has made it work, and that could in turn be of great help to others.

This produces a nutritious and delicious dried fruit, which can be enjoyed through the all year. There are several different varieties of fig, all of which vary widely in texture and color. Figs nutrition was even more appreciated in the past because this fruit was often used as a sweetener – before the time of refined sugar.

Due to the great content of potassium and calcium, this fruit can prevent osteoporosis (bone thinning) and helps to improve bone density.
13. Support Good Sleep
Fig contains tryptophan, which can induce good sleep and prevent sleeping disorders, as insomnia.
How to Select and Store Figs
The season for fresh figs is amid summer and fall, with the timing dependent on the assortment. Figs are delicate and rapidly perishable, and are usually best consumed within 1 -2 days after buying. When picking figs, select those that are tender and plump, have a rich and deep color and without bruising. Ripe figs shouldn’t be washed till ready to consume. They should be kept in the refrigerator for about 2 days. If figs aren’t still ripe, you should keep them at room temperature to ripen.
You can keep dried figs for much longer. When buying dried figs, make sure to buy free from mold and soft. You should keep dried figs in a cool and dark place, or into a fridge.
Figs can be eaten either unpeeled or peeled, depending on the thickness of their skin and of course, the personal preference.
Potential Side Effects of Figs
Individuals with skin and allergies to mulberry, weeping fig, or natural rubber latex may have potential reactions to fig fruit or leaves. If you’re harvesting the fruit straight from the tree (just like I do), it is best to wear gloves and long sleeves.
People who have diabetes should be careful when eating or using figs medicinally, as they have an effect on glucose levels in the blood. This also goes for people on insulin and diabetes medication, as this fruit can alter their effectiveness. In this case, you should consult your GP before using figs.

While I was serving, I had a mental breakdown and was honorably discharged. Afterwards, I had another mental breakdown, lost my job, and attempted suicide 6 times.
“But when I got out of a crisis home, my mental health had improved. I felt empowered. I was a homeless veteran, living under a bridge, but I searched endlessly for work. One day, a landscaping business owner found me and helped me start my own small business, Handy Jim’s Handyman Service. Starting that business finally got me off the streets.
 “While I was serving, I had a mental breakdown and was honorably discharged. Afterwards, I had another mental breakdown, lost my job, and attempted suicide 6 times.” 
“When my wife and I had a baby, I was only making $300 a month and qualified for welfare. At the time, my business wasn’t considered ‘work,’ so I did community service to get the stipend and food stamps my family needed to survive. When Bill Clinton reformed welfare, my business finally became recognized as valid ‘work.’ Thanks to that reform, I was able to grow my business all the way to a multi-million dollar enterprise — and get off welfare.
“But when the bubble burst in 2007, my income was down again. I suffered through four heart attacks and was denied health insurance. My medical bills dissolved our entire retirement savings, and I had to close my business. My wife struggled to find work and we had over a half-million dollars in debt, so we almost lost our home. She just found a job, but the welfare system isn’t incremental like it was under Bill Clinton. Now my family has $500 less per year than we did before.
 “Every day, I fought to keep my American Dream alive, and Hillary was always cheering me on. It’s high time she takes the reigns and turns our country back into a place where anyone can live their American dream.” 
“My heart disease is terminal, and everything I’ve worked for is gone. I just want to carry on and leave what I have left for my wife. Hillary Clinton has spent her life fighting for people like me. She believes everyone has the right to affordable healthcare and education. I went from rags to riches and back again, rising high under Democratic leadership, and falling under Republican administrations. Every day, I fought to keep my American Dream alive, and Hillary was always cheering me on. It’s high time she takes the reigns and turns our country back into a place where everyone can live out their American dream.”

409cbf7f,http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/10/22/scse-o22.html,US navy sends destroyer to challenge China in South China Sea,"The US Navy yesterday carried out a provocative new challenge to Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea by sending a guided missile destroyer, the USS Decatur, close to Chinese-administered islands in the Paracel group. The so-called freedom of navigation operation took place amid mounting concern in Washington over the diplomatic lurch towards China by US ally, the Philippines, under its new president, Rodrigo Duterte.
American officials told Reuters that the USS Decatur sailed near to Triton and Woody Islands in the Paracels, but did not enter the 12-nautical-mile territorial limit in either case. White House spokesman Josh Earnest declared that the naval operation had been to demonstrate that “coastal states may not unlawfully restrict the navigation rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea” by the United States and all other states.
The naval intrusion into disputed waters is the first since July, when the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague ruled in favour of a US-backed legal case contesting Chinese claims. The US navy had carried out three previous “freedom of navigation” operations close to Chinese controlled islets, sending a destroyer within 12 nautical miles of Subi Reef in October 2015, Triton Island in January this year and Fiery Cross Reef in May.
The latest operation, close to Woody Island, which functions as China’s administrative centre in the South China Sea, is particularly provocative. As tensions with the US have mounted, China has placed anti-aircraft missile systems on the island and flown fighter jets there. Woody Island is to the south of major Chinese naval facilities on Hainan Island, adjacent to the Chinese mainland.
The Chinese Defence Ministry branded the US operation “illegal” and “intentionally provocative behavior,” and lodged a protest with the US. It accused Washington of being a “troublemaker when it comes to the stability of the South China Sea” and urged it to respect China’s “national sovereignty and security interests.”
The ministry warned that the Chinese military would increase its patrols, strengthen its defence capabilities and “resolutely defend national sovereignty and security.” Two Chinese warships, the Guangzhou and the Luoyang, shadowed the USS Decatur and demanded it leave the area.
The US naval operation took place just one day after Philippine President Duterte concluded his state visit to Beijing, during which he declared that he was “separating” the Philippines from the United States both diplomatically and militarily. In his bid for billions of dollars in Chinese aid and investment, Duterte played down his country’s territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea.
Duterte’s tilt towards China is in marked contrast to the foreign policy orientation of his immediate predecessor, President Benigno Aquino, who spearheaded the Obama administration’s efforts to confront Beijing in the South China Sea. Aquino had ramped up closer military ties with the US, including via a new basing agreement that has already opened up five Philippine bases to American forces, and adopted a confrontational approach in territorial disputes with China. At one point, he likened Beijing to the Nazi regime in Germany.
Duterte’s about-face is a significant blow to Washington’s “pivot to Asia”—an all-embracing diplomatic confrontation and military build-up against China over the past five years throughout the Asian region. Hillary Clinton, as Obama’s secretary of state, was central to the launching of the “pivot,” including by fueling tensions in the South China Sea through her declaration in 2010 that the US had “a national interest” in the disputed waters. The South China Sea is central to the Pentagon’s strategy for war against China, which includes a massive air and missile attack on the Chinese mainland, supplemented by a crippling naval blockade.
Unnamed US officials have denied that yesterday’s dispatch of the USS Decatur was in response to Duterte’s trip to China. But such denials ring false. By sending a warship to challenge Chinese claims, Washington is sending a warning both to Beijing and Duterte that it will not tolerate any undermining of its strategic dominance in East Asia. The naval intrusion is also aimed at stemming any attempt by other South East Asian countries to follow Duterte’s example in developing their own arrangements with Beijing.
Duterte’s failure to press China over The Hague ruling has significantly undermined Washington’s plan to escalate its confrontation with Beijing over the South China Sea. Without Philippine backing, the Obama administration cannot readily intervene in Manila’s maritime disputes with China. The US is not a party to the territorial disputes and, moreover, has failed to ratify the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea under which the legal case was heard.
The choice of the Paracels for the latest “freedom of navigation” operation suggests a shift in tactics by the US and an orientation to Vietnam, rather than the Philippines—in the short term at least. Vietnam has, with Washington’s encouragement, adopted a more confrontational stance towards China.
For his part, Duterte, an erratic right-wing populist, is continuing his efforts to balance between the United States and China. Having secured large loans and investments from Beijing, he made clear yesterday that he was not about to burn his bridges with Washington. Speaking in the Philippines yesterday on his return from China, he declared he did not intend to sever ties with the United States. “I cannot do that. Why? It’s to the best interest of my country that we maintain that relationship,” he said.
Since taking office this year, Duterte has branded President Obama the “son of a whore,” called for US troops to leave the southern island of Mindanao and signaled an end to joint exercises with the US. His anti-US bluster has been aimed, in part, at securing closer economic ties with China, while appealing to anti-imperialist sentiment within the Philippines, a former American colony. He is, however, walking a tightrope. Washington will have no compunction in orchestrating a regime-change operation in Manila if Duterte threatens its interests.
The rising tide of American militarism and geo-political rivalries in Asia—as in the Middle East—underscores the danger that a miscalculation or mistake by any of the countries involved in the South China Sea, or in other tense regional flashpoints, can trigger a military clash, setting off a conflict between nuclear-armed powers.

On April 21, an unidentified woman was on her knees with her hands in the air as she was screaming that her children were on the ship. Scott Thomas, a passenger on the ship, recorded the incident on his cellphone.
""This ship ain’t even trying to slow down,"" Thomas said during the video.
Known as the Norwegian Breakaway, the 144,000-ton ship was in the middle of a seven-day-cruise to Florida and the Bahamas, according to the Daily Mail. After departing from New York on April 17, the ship sailed to Port Canaveral, Florida, then stopped at Great Stirrup Cay and Nassau.
According to Brady Forbes, who talked to the family while in an elevator on the ship, the children and father were already on board, but the mother had not returned yet.
""After that, the husband went out to look for the wife and the ship gave them more time than normal,"" Forbes explained. ""They found the wife but obviously not in time as the ship sailed away.""
After it left port, it spent three days at sea on its way to New York. 
Molly McIntyre, a consultant with Cruise.co.uk, explained that some cruise lines let children stay on the ship while their parents are onshore.
“Personally as a mother of four I do use the kids club but would never leave them on board alone,” McIntyre said.
""What I don’t understand is why this lady was late back as the departure time is always displayed in the daily schedule and normally there is a sign as you get off the ship that asks you to be back on board 30 minutes before departure,"" McIntyre said.
The ship left at 5:30 p.m., and the woman returned about a minute too late.
""I didn’t think they would do that,"" a woman remarked in the video. ""I guess I was wrong.""
""I told you they’d do that,"" Thomas responded. ""When it’s 5:30 it’s 5:30 […] Not 5:31, not 5:32, 5:30.""

Danesiah Neal, 14, an eighth grader at Christa McAuliffe Middle School in Houston, was investigated by police after school officials accused her of using fake money to buy lunch.
""I went to the lunch line, and they said my $2 bill was fake,"" Danesiah, who was 13 at the time, told KTRK. ""They gave it to the police. Then they sent me to the police office. A police officer said I could be in big trouble.""
Danesiah's grandmother, Sharon Kay Joseph -- who had given her the $2 bill -- received a phone call from school officials just after the incident.
""'Did you give Danesiah a $2 bill for lunch?'"" Joseph recalled being asked. ""He told me it was fake.""
The Fort Bend Independent School District police eventually discovered that a local convenience store had given the $2 bill to Joseph. The detectives then visited a bank where the 1953-issued bill was inspected and determined to be real.
""He brought me my $2 bill back,"" Joseph said. ""He didn’t apologize. He should have, and the school should have because they pulled Danesiah out of lunch, and she didn’t eat lunch that day because they took her money.""
""It was very outrageous for them to do it,"" Joseph added. ""There was no need for police involvement. They’re charging kids like they’re adults now.""
During the 2013-2014 school year, 40 similar cases were reported in the three Houston-area school districts.
According to their records, all of the 40 kids who were investigated were minority students -- most of them Black or Hispanic, EAG News reported.
""We see a disproportionate impact on minority youth when it comes to these charges,"" attorney Mani Nezami said, according to KTRK. ""African-American and Hispanic boys in particular, but girls as well, tend to be overcriminalized for offenses that one might speculate if they weren't, they wouldn't be seeing a criminal charge.""

The Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx married story is about to make Suri’s world a little complicated. According to reports, Jamie Foxx is going to apply to the court to take Suri Cruise as his own. 
Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are reportedly fighting over Suri, as to who gets custody. Foxx, according to a reliable source, wants to prove to Katie that he is serious with her and her daughter. This step is next to the Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx marriage. 
In adoption regarding a stepparent, the other birth parent’s consent is necessary. 
Katie Holmes And Jamie Foxx Married: Will Tom Cruise willingly give his consent to the adoption
The consent, however, is not required in cases of a neglected child, abandoned or the parent failed to pay child support. The other birth parent’s rights are immediately terminated in such cases. 
In light of this, Tom Cruise has given $ 4.8 million for his daughter Suri’s educational and medical expenses. It has already been three years since Suri and his father talked and seen each other. Things between father and daughter, according to reports, have not been so well.

Be that as it may, an interview with Foxx’s representative said that the adoption rumors are false. He also said that the Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx marriage are untruthful because the two are not romantically involved in the first place. Further, he said that society is so thirsty for something to talk about nowadays that anyone will believe everything they read in tabloids and on social media.
Katie Holmes filed for divorce in July 2012 before Cruise turned 50. Holmes left abruptly and stayed in a New York apartment with their daughter, Suri. The two are not on speaking terms, not even about their daughter.

Defense Secretary Ash Carter arrives in Baghdad on Oct. 22, 2016, to meet with his commanders and assess progress in the opening days of operations to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State militants. His visit comes two days after a U.S. service member was killed outside Mosul, underscoring the risk that American troops are taking as they support Iraqi forces.
 (Lolita Baldor / AP)  
U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter's push for Iraq to let Turkey play a role in the battle to retake Mosul from the Islamic State group encountered stiff resistance Saturday from Iraq's prime's minister, who said his country's forces will oust the militants from the northern city.
""I know that the Turks want to participate, we tell them thank you, this is something the Iraqis will handle and the Iraqis will liberate Mosul and the rest of the territories,"" Haider al-Abadi said through a translator after meeting with the Pentagon chief.
Iraqi, Kurdish and other local forces will handle the battle for Mosul, al-Abadi said.
""We don't have any problems,"" he said, adding that if help is needed, ""we will ask for it from Turkey or from other regional countries.""
Carter told reporters the issue of a Turkish role in the Mosul fight is a difficult subject, and that Abadi said in the meeting he has had talks with the Turks and expected to have more.
Iraqi sovereignty is a key principle, Carter said, and the American role is to work with partners in the coalition and try to resolve such matters, and ensure that everyone is focused on fighting IS.
""I am confident that we can plan a constructive role there,"" he said, adding that Turkey is a member of the coalition.
One day earlier, Carter met with Turkish leaders in Ankara and told reporters of ""an agreement in principle"" for Turkey to play a role in the Mosul battle. Carter stressed at the time that any final decision would be up to the Iraqis, while expressing optimism the Turks and Iraqis could settle their differences.

Carter arrived in Iraq on Saturday to meet with his commanders and assess the progress in the opening days of the Mosul operation.
His visit came two days after a U.S. service member was killed outside Mosul, underscoring the risk that American troops are taking as they advise Iraqi forces in the fight.
Carter, who already has been to Iraq twice this year, has overseen the steady increase in the number of U.S. forces deployed to the fight and the growth of America's effort to train and advise Iraqi troops. In his two earlier visits, Carter announced White House decisions to increase the U.S. troop level there. There were no expectations he would do that again.
During his stop in Baghdad, Carter met with Lt. Gen. Steve Townsend, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, and other leaders.
Carter's meetings in Turkey were a sign of moves to ease tensions between Turkey and Iraq over Turkish military operations in northern Iraq. That divide has grown as the operation to retake Mosul began to take shape.
Some 500 Turkish troops at a base north of Mosul have been training Sunni and Kurdish fighters since last December. The Iraqi government says the troops are there without permission and has called on them to withdraw. Turkey has refused, and insists it will play a role in liberating the city.
The U.S. service member killed this week was the fourth U.S. combat death in Iraq since the U.S. began military operations against IS in August 2014. It was the first since the Mosul operation began, and the service member was working with Iraqi special forces northeast of Mosul and serving as an explosive ordnance disposal specialist.
U.S. military officials said a fire at a sulfur plant in northern Iraq set by IS on Thursday was creating a potential breathing hazard for American forces and other troops at a base south of Mosul that's being used by troops as a staging area. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
They said troops at the base were wearing protective masks, and that air samples were sent to the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency for analysis. Officials estimated it could take two to three days to put the fire out.
U.S. defense and military officials have said that while the offensive has started well, they expect the complex fight for the city to get more difficult. They said they will be watching to see how aggressively the militants fight and whether more leaders flee the city.
In what officials thought was an attempted diversion from the Mosul fight, IS attacked targets in and around the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Friday in a coordinated assault that killed at least 14 people.
A U.S. military officer said IS had set up a multilayered defense in and around Mosul. The outer rings of this defense are what the U.S. military calls disruption zones, where IS fighters are expected to counter the Iraqi advance through the use of mortars and rockets, suicide bombers, road obstacles and car bombs.
The official said the U.S. does not expect this to include high-intensity force-on-force combat in these outer rings. The expected IS focus will be on disrupting and delaying the Iraqi advance rather than trying to hold ground outside the city. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
The U.S. estimates there are between 3,000 and 5,000 IS fighters in the Mosul area, but some leaders probably have fled. A key factor will be how long those midlevel commanders stay or whether they decide to leave.
More than 4,800 U.S. troops are in Iraq and there are more than 100 U.S. special operations forces operating with Iraqi units. Hundreds more U.S. forces are playing a support role in staging bases farther from the front lines.

abd49f14,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/off-his-message-again-trump-vows-to-sue-all-female-accusers/2016/10/22/375d5de2-98b4-11e6-9cae-2a3574e296a6_story.html,Off his message again: Trump vows to sue all female accusers,"GETTYSBURG, Pa. — Steering his campaign toward controversy yet again, Donald Trump vowed Saturday to sue every woman who has accused him of sexual assault or other inappropriate behavior. He called them “liars” whose allegations he blamed Democrats for orchestrating.

Trump’s blunt threat of legal action eclipsed his planned focus on serious-minded policy during a speech in Gettysburg. Though his campaign had billed the speech as a chance for Trump to lay out a to-do list for his first 100 days as president, he seemed unable to restrain himself from re-litigating grievances with Hillary Clinton, the media and especially the women who have come forward in recent days.

“All of these liars will be sued once the election is over,” Trump said. He added later: “I look so forward to doing that.”

Nearly a dozen women have publicly accused Trump of unwanted advances or sexual assault in the weeks since a 2005 recording emerged in which the former reality TV star boasted of kissing women and groping their genitals without their consent. The latest came on Saturday, when an adult film actress said the billionaire kissed her and two other women on the lips “without asking for permission” when they met him after a golf tournament in 2006.

Trump has denied all the allegations, while insisting some of the women weren’t attractive enough for him to want to pursue.

“Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,” he said. Without offering evidence, he surmised that Clinton or the Democratic National Committee had put the women up to it.

Speaking to reporters aboard her campaign plane, Clinton said: “I saw where our opponent Donald Trump went to Gettysburg, one of the most extraordinary places in American history, and basically said if he’s president he’ll spend his time suing women who have made charges against him based on his behavior.” She also said the suggestion that Democrats or her campaign were encouraging women to level accusations against Trump “inaccurate.”

Trump’s broadside against the women came at the start of an otherwise substantive speech that sought to weave the many policy ideas he has put forward into a single, cohesive agenda that he said he would pursue aggressively during his first three months in office.

The Republican nominee vowed to lift restrictions on domestic energy production, label China as a currency manipulator and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, familiar themes to supporters who have flocked to his rallies this year.

“This is my pledge to you, and if we follow these steps, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people,” Trump said, invoking a phrase from President Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address.

Though mostly a recap of policies he’s proposed before, Trump’s speech included a few new elements, such as a freeze on hiring new federal workers and a two-year mandatory minimum sentence for immigrants who re-enter the U.S. illegally after being deported a first time. In a pledge sure to raise eyebrows on Wall Street, he said he’d block a potential merger between AT&T and media conglomerate Time Warner.

Translating his proposals into digestible bullet points, he offered to-the-point titles for the legislative vehicles he’d need Congress to approve to accomplish his goals, such as the “End Illegal Immigration Act” and the “Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act.”

Throughout the GOP primary, Trump was criticized for shying away from detailed policy proposals. But his speech, which aides said would form the core of his closing argument to voters, underscored how the billionaire has gradually compiled a broad — if sometimes vague — policy portfolio that straddles conservative, isolationist and populist orthodoxies.

Yet any headway that Trump may have made was likely to be diluted by his legal threats against his accusers, just the latest example of Trump stepping on his intended message at inopportune moments. Days earlier, during the final debate, his otherwise well-received performance was marred by an alarming statement near the end that he might not accept the outcome of the election if he loses.

Trump didn’t say what kind of lawsuits he planned to file against the women, but any libel litigation could be complicated by the fact that Trump, in the 2005 recording, bragged about the same kind of conduct the women now accuse him of perpetrating. Trump recently vowed to sue The New York Times for libel, but has not yet followed through on the threat.

With the debates now over, Trump and Clinton have few apparent opportunities to alter the course the race substantially — a reality that benefits Clinton more than Trump. The Republican is trailing his opponent in most of the battleground states while Clinton eyes potential upset victories in traditionally safe GOP territory, with Arizona at the top of the list.

An increasingly confident Clinton on Saturday made what’s become her closing pitch in Pittsburgh, stressing unity and asking her backers to carry her message to any Trump supporters they meet.

“I understand that they need a president who cares about them, will listen to them and I want to be their president,” she said.

As Election Day nears, Clinton is also focusing on getting Democrats elected to Congress. She attacked the state’s Republican senator, Pat Toomey, saying he has refused to “stand up” to Trump as she touted his Democratic challenger, Katie McGinty.

Her campaign headquarters in New York was back up and running after a scare over an envelope that arrived containing a white powdery substance. Initial tests showed the substance wasn’t harmful.

Meanwhile, Clinton was getting a campaign boost Saturday from singer and pop icon Katy Perry, who was pushing early voting in Las Vegas.

More than 4.4 million votes have already been cast. Data compiled by The Associated Press found that Clinton appeared to be displaying strength in crucial North Carolina and Florida, while Trump appeared to be holding ground in Ohio, Iowa and Georgia.

Lederman reported from Washington. Associated Press writer Catherine Lucey in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.

The stars say he REALLY can't stand this.
Physical attraction is completely subjective. What one person may consider a physical flaw or turn off is very appealing to the next. Some guys like a woman to be on the thin side and aren't attracted to a woman who is curvier, while others are much more attracted to a woman with curves than one who is very slender.
You just never know, and therefore, you have to be happy and confident with what you have. You can't change for anybody but yourself.
Now, that's not to say that you shouldn't take the best care of yourself, because ultimately you'll feel better. If you don't practice good oral hygiene you could get all kinds of nasty health issues, and if you don't take a shower from time to time, you'll not only smell but you'll probably feel pretty unhappy and miserable with yourself.
How we feel about ourselves is reflected in the way we look, and how we look can affect the way we feel.
If you're interested in a guy who only wants a perfect woman or a 10 on the looks scale, you need to try to find someone else. He's not perfect, so why should you be? Why should anyone aim for perfection when it's our flaws and imperfections that make us human?
Besides, if you're too focused on what you perceive as being wrong with you, you'll spend so much time on that one issue that you'll miss out on a lot of life. If something is an easy change — such as flossing or brushing your hair — then it makes sense to do it and to make it a positive habit.
When people have strict lists of what they will or will not tolerate in a partner, they narrow down their opportunities to meet all kinds of people. Haven't you ever thought you were only attracted to one type of person, and then found yourself going for their complete opposite?
You never know what you're going to be attracted to. It could be a crooked smile or a dazzling sense of humor. But here's the one physical trait he can't stand in a woman, according to his zodiac sign.

So, after stumbling across something that caught my eye, I tried the T-shirt curling hack to see if it would make my life easier. Simply put, I am always down for beauty methods that make me feel fabulous in no time.
The T-shirt curling hack, otherwise known as creating ""plopping curls,"" is a self-explanatory method that involves using a T-shirt to create beach babe waves. As someone who lives by the sea and adores mermaiden hair, I couldn't resist trying it out for myself. According to a YouTube presenter appearing in a Cute Girls Hairstyles video entitled, ""No-Heat Plopping Curls | Back-to-School Hairstyles"" the hack takes its name from the process of ""plopping"" your hair into the tee. The shirt is then tied around the wearer's head and worn all day or overnight, so the curls can form. I was amazed at the miraculous curls that unravelled out of the presenter's T-shirt wrap. 
Being a lady with naturally straight hair, I was enamored with this method and realized that if it actually worked on my tresses, it could save me a bunch of time in the mornings as I wouldn't need to dry or style my hair after washing it. There was a small, doubtful voice inside my head, but I ignored it and tried the T-shirt hack out for myself. 
The Inspiration
As previously touched upon, I took my inspiration from the above YouTube tutorial by Cute Girls Hairstyles. I did however, see other videos, some of which suggested that ""hair plopping"" was a hack for naturally curly hair, which had alarm bells ringing in my head, because my hair is not curly in the slightest.
So I scooted back over to the Cute Girls Hairstyles video, re-watched it, and made sure to check the description for any information suggesting that ""plopping curls"" were only suitable for naturally curly hair. Mindy — presumably the same Mindy who presents the video — writes in the video description, ""For this tutorial, it is a T-shirt creating the curls."" I supposed this meant it would work for me.
During the tutorial, when she's flipped her head upside-down in preparation to plop. ""Give your hair a shake at the roots, this is just gonna' kind of separate the curls and any natural curl that you do have is gonna' come out at this point."" IMO, during this clip, it looked like she was loosely finger-combing her hair, but her mane didn't look particularly naturally curly. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised to see her wet locks go from fairly straight, to beautifully bouncy and wavy. I couldn't wait to get started!
The Method
I started by washing my hair. Here I am straight out of the shower with wet tresses. In the video description, Mindy writes, ""Be sure to start with your hair slightly more than damp, not 'dripping' wet. If the hair is too wet, your curls will not turn out. As a reference point, be sure to notice how wet my hair is when I begin the plopping.""
As a bit of background information, my hair is ridiculously thick. A friend of mine (who's a qualified hairdresser) told me that it's not just the amount of hair I have that makes my mane thick, but my individual strands are thick too. It literally takes me twenty minutes to dry my whole head of hair with a hairdryer. I rarely let my hair dry naturally, because the last time I did this it basically didn't dry — I slept in a braid and twenty-four hours later, I took it out to reveal damp hair, so I still ended up having to use my hairdryer anyway. 
With this in mind, I knew my hair would need a little helping hand. So although this hack was supposed to be heatless, I gave my locks a quick blast with the hairdryer, because I knew it would never work on my mane if I didn't.
Next, I grabbed some mousse as Mindy suggested in the tutorial.
I am not someone who uses mousse on a regular basis, so I guessed that this blob would suffice.
Finally, I followed Mindy's tips on wrapping my hair in a T-shirt. In hindsight, I probably should have used a tee with larger sleeves so I could secure it more easily. But, it seemed solid, so I took a trip to the land of nod.
The Results
After a rather uncomfortable night's sleep, where I felt the T-shirt slipping off multiple times in the night, I awoke to this scene. However, I was still optimistic about my potential curls, especially considering I'd partly dried my hair and kept my tee on for approximately nine hours.
Suffice to say, when I unravelled my towel and found this monstrosity, I was not impressed.
As you can see, my hair was not curly in the least, heck, it wasn't even dry! My mane was wet through and I felt super disappointed.
From the back, you can see how it might have worked if it had dried — my hair was more wavy than usual, but it was definitely more surfer girl than beach babe.
I believe it could have gone awry for a number of reasons: My hair is too thick to dry naturally while trapped in a T-shirt, the one I chose didn't have long enough sleeves to keep the style rigid throughout the night, I put too much mousse on, or maybe this really is a hack for people with naturally curly hair.
To conclude, this ""hack"" actually made my morning routine longer, as I had to painstakingly brush out the knots and tangles, then dry it with a hairdryer — both of which I could have done immediately after my shower and saved time in the long run. It's safe to say, I won't be ""plopping"" again anytime soon!

So cold, that an elderly woman was found frozen to the ground in Tennessee on Feb. 20.
Keith Sheldon was roaming around in Williamson County, taking photographs of the snow before it melted.
The photographer came across an abandoned car stuck in the ice on a dead-end road near Franklin and decided to take pictures of it.
“I was going to come over here and get a picture of the car and the license plate just for the church to have in case they had any questions,” Sheldon told News 2.
But when he looked through the lens to capture the photo, he noticed something alarming: An elderly woman lying in the fetal position on the ground.
“She was lying right there against the dirt bank and she blended in, had a brown coat on and it looked just like dirt,” said Sheldon.
Sheldon discovered the elderly woman at around 9:30 a.m., when the temperature was about 12 degrees. He said he tried talking to the woman, who seemed disoriented and refused his help.
“I was here at the car, and I was yelling at her, ‘Hello? Can you hear me?’ and I got no response,” Sheldon said.
He called 911 and paramedics arrived at the scene 10 minutes later.
“She was frozen to the ground,” Sheldon said. “Whenever we lifted her up, she was frozen to the ground.”
The woman was later identified as 74-year-old Patricia from Bellevue, Tennessee. Her last name was not released.
Franklin police took the woman to a nearby hospital, where she was treated for hypothermia and released shortly after.
Patricia’s family told News 2 she suffers from a brain dysfunction and had been missing for two days. A missing persons report was filed for her.

Darrell Issa (R-CA) for touting a bill signed by Obama in a ""shameless"" campaign mailer, the Republican congressman responded by railing against the President's ""serious scandals.""
""I’m disappointed but not surprised that the president, in a political speech, continues to deny accountability for the serious scandals that happened under his watch where Americans died overseas and veterans have died here at home,"" Issa said in a statement obtained by CNN. ""You’d be hard pressed to find anyone who thinks I’ve done too much to hold Washington accountable. I’ve worked with the administration on good legislation where it was possible, and called out wrongdoing wherever I saw it, and will continue to do so.""
During a Sunday fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in California, Obama noted the irony in Issa's campaign material touting a bill signed by the President after the congressman led several investigations into the administration as chair of the House Oversight Committee.
“Now, that is the definition of chutzpah,” Obama said. “Here’s a guy who called my administration perhaps the most corrupt in history — despite the fact that actually we have not had a major scandal in my administration — that, when Trump was suggesting that I wasn’t even born here, said, well, I don’t know, was not sure. We can pull up the quotes.”
The President said that Issa's ""primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollar on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere.""

80b92df9,http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/modern-greek-legend-paintings-decay,Fantastical Paintings Update Greek Mythology for Modern Times,"Reciprocal Determanism, 2016, Jake Scharbach. All images courtesy of the artist and Brilliant Champions Gallery
References to classicism and antiquity are paired with a diverse range of imagery from the 21st century in the paintings of Jake Scharbach, a unison that is aesthetically harmonious but ultimately disheartening. There is a strong sense of cultural disillusionment and this intersection is reflected in the title of his ongoing exhibition The Echo’s Decay at Brilliant Champions Gallery. The show eels like a symbolic prophecy exploring how the past reverberates today.
CONTEINGENCY MANAGEMENT, 2016, Jake Scharbach
The artist’s process involves an intense amount of research and mental pairing. “I start out by printing as many images as I can; stuff from my own travels, pictures I take in museums, and lots of Google Image searches. I put everything on the wall and just look for a long time until I begin to make associations,” Scharbach tells The Creators Project.
INSTINCTUAL DRIFT, 2016, Jake Scharbach
“It’s like trying to put a puzzle together. Sometimes a combination will leap out right away, sometimes it takes more effort. In the end, I try to come up with as many possible scenarios as I can, then edit. The final image has to attract me, be intriguing for reasons I can’t explain. I have to want to spend time with it, to know more.”
UNCONVENTIONAL PARTICIPATION, 2016, Jake Scharbach
In one half of the painting UNCONVETIONAL PARTICIPATION a figure that appears to be Dionysus, the Greek God of wine and fertility, prepares his fist to land on an unseen figure while the other half of the painting reveals a riot police officer grabbing a civilian by the head, as if positioning him to receive the blow. Peering into INSTINCTUAL DRIFT, what looks like some sort of leisurely feast from ancient times cracks into various fragments that reveal a congested traffic jam, rendered in black and white as if to emphasize the dull, pointlessness of the situation. In ENDEMIC the decimated hood of a BMW crashes through a Rubens painting, The Massacre of Innocents, where children lie helplessly in pools of their own blood.
CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT, 2016, Jake Scharbach
Scharbach’s comparative study of past and present culture was initially about revering the past and having disdain for the present. “In the beginning, I was thinking more about the contrast between beauty and horror. Classical art looked beautiful to me, representative of a type of culture that valued the aesthetic of a sublime experience and a relationship to nature,” the artist explains to The Creators Project. “And all I had to do to find the opposite of that was walk out of my front door. Auto body shops, piles of tires, traffic belching black smoke, chemical factories…”
ADAPTIVE EXPECTATIONS, 2016, Jake Scharbach
“Lately, I have become aware of another level of analysis where the two halves are actually reuniting two parts of the same timeline. There is common shared behavior,” Scharbach adds. “Civilization has a trajectory and by making these kinds of comparisons, it helps to clarify the direction we are headed.”
MODIFIED DURATION, 2014, Jake Scharbach
The Echo’s Decay will be on view at Brooklyn’s Brilliant Champions Gallery until November 19th. More of Jake Scharbach’s paintings, as well as videos and sculptures, can be viewed here.

3466f95a,http://saintpetersblog.com/donald-trump-rejects-phony-polls-insists-winning/,"Donald Trump rejects 'phony' polls, insists 'we are winning'","A defiant Donald Trump blamed his campaign struggles on “phony polls” from the “disgusting” media on Monday, fighting to energize his most loyal supporters as his path to the presidency shrinks.
With just 14 days until the election, the Republican nominee campaigned in battleground Florida as his team conceded publicly as well as privately that crucial Pennsylvania may be slipping away to Democrat Hillary Clinton. That would leave him only a razor-thin pathway to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House on Nov. 8.
Despite continued difficulties with women and minorities, Trump refuses to soften his message in the campaign’s final days to broaden his coalition. Yet he offered an optimistic front in the midst of a three-day tour through Florida as thousands began voting there in person.
“I believe we’re actually winning,” Trump declared during a roundtable discussion with farmers gathered next to a local pumpkin patch.
A day after suggesting the First Amendment to the Constitution may give journalists too much freedom, he insisted that the media are promoting biased polls to discourage his supporters from voting.
“The media isn’t just against me. They’re against all of you,” Trump told cheering supporters later in St. Augustine. “They’re against what we represent.”
In more bad news for Trump, a new poll shows young voters turning to Clinton now that the race has settled down to two main candidates. Clinton now leads among likely voters 18 to 30 years in age by 60 percent to 19 percent, according to a new GenForward survey.
Young black voters already were solidly in her corner, and now young whites are moving her way, according to the survey by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
With Trump on the defensive, Democrat Clinton worked to slam the door on his candidacy in swing state New Hampshire while eyeing a possible Democratic majority in the Senate.
The former secretary of state campaigned alongside New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, who is running for the Senate, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was merciless as she seized on recent revelations of Trump’s predatory sexual language and several allegations of sexual assault.
“He thinks that because he has a mouth full of Tic Tacs, he can force himself on any woman within groping distance,” Warren charged. “I’ve got news for you Donald: Women have had it with guys like you.”
Trump has denied all of the recent allegations, and he addressed a new one Monday in an interview with WGIR radio in New Hampshire.
He called the accusations “total fiction” and lashed out at former adult film performer Jessica Drake, who said Saturday that he had grabbed and kissed her without permission and offered her money to visit his hotel room a decade ago.
“One said, ‘He grabbed me on the arm.’ And she’s a porn star,” Trump said. He added, “Oh, I’m sure she’s never been grabbed before.”
With Election Day two weeks away, Trump’s electoral map looks bleak.
The Republican National Committee ignored him altogether in mailers to New Hampshire voters set to be distributed later this week, according to material obtained by The Associated Press. The mail focuses instead on Clinton’s credibility, featuring a picture of her and former President Bill Clinton and the words, “No More of The Lying Clintons.”
Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway outlined a path to 270 electoral votes on Sunday that banks on victories in Florida, Ohio, Iowa and North Carolina along with New Hampshire and Maine’s 2nd Congressional District. Assuming Trump wins all of those – and he currently trails in some – he would earn the exact number of electoral votes needed to win the presidency and no more.
Noticeably absent from the list was Pennsylvania, a state that a top adviser privately conceded was slipping away despite Trump’s aggressive courtship of the state’s white working-class voters. The adviser spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal discussions.
Florida was largely the focus on Monday as in-person early voting began across 50 counties, including the state’s largest: Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Orange and Palm Beach. Remaining counties will start in the coming week.
Early voting by mail has been underway for weeks. Nearly 1.2 million voters in Florida have already mailed in ballots.
Clinton plans to visit Tuesday and Wednesday, while her running mate, Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, was making two Florida appearances on Monday. He took a shot at Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio in the first, a reminder that Clinton’s team is fighting to retake a Senate majority.
Kaine noted that Rubio previously called Trump a dangerous “con artist,” though the senator currently supports him.
Democrats would take the Senate majority if they pick up four seats and Clinton wins the White House.
Trump’s difficulties are evident in this week’s travel plans, which include a possible stop in Arizona. A Democratic presidential candidate hasn’t won there in 20 years, yet polls show Trump in a close race.
Republicans look worse in New Hampshire, a state Trump must win in the scenario his campaign manager outlined.
“Women voters can sway elections here,” said Republican strategist Ryan Williams. “And he’s doing nothing to reach out to them.”

It’s that magical time of year again, when all of Victoria’s Secret’s angels ascend to Earth for one night to strut their wings in the brand’s annual fashion show. While we have plenty of questions about this year’s festivities — will Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid walk again? Who will wear the iconic multi-million dollar Fantasy Bra? Which famous singer will perform? — We do know one thing for certain: the location!
For the very first time the show will be held in… Paris! The supermodels are descending on the City of Light and as you can see in their adorable teaser video, they already have their bags packed and ready! (Unclear if their Français is up to speed yet!)
Models set to make their repeat appearance include veterans Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio and Lily Aldridge, plus relative newbies Elsa Hosk, Jasmine Tookes, Josephine Skriver, Lais Ribeiro, Martha Hunt, Romee Strijd, Sara Sampaio, Stella Maxwell and Taylor Hill. (See Martha, Elsa and Taylor give us an exclusive sneak preview of their favorite things in France, below!)
The shows have typically been held in N.Y.C., only switching it up for London in 2014, and while this marks the first time the brand is hitting Paris, it did have a show in Cannes way back in 2000. (It’s worth clicking on this link to see the looks back then.)
While we wait for the big night (airing December 5 on CBS!), we can look forward to a ton of workout inspo posts to hit the models’ social media feeds.

But just how does Rob feel about all of this? Find out here what he’s planning to do.
Blac Chyna, 28, may be insisting that her and Rob Kardashian‘s, 29, baby girl lives with her at her house, but she’s not planning to keep her fiancé out of the picture! In fact, the two actually have a very practical co-parenting plan in place, according to TMZ. And while baby Kardashian, once she arrives early next month, WILL have a permanent residence at Blac’s pad, Rob will too — at least for the time being!
Rob and Blac are reportedly getting along well right now and, as a bit of a trial run, Rob’s even been staying over at her place for a few weeks now. So far, things have reportedly been smooth sailing! SO great to hear, right? Especially since the pair are usually so hot and cold. Let’s not forget that Blac has kicked Rob out of her house multiple times since the two began dating earlier this year.
But while the duo is doing well, Rob still wants to make sure he has a backup plan…just in case. Their current plan is to share parental duties at Blac’s house, but Rob isn’t quite jumping ship just yet. He’s reportedly still keeping his Calabasas home because during times of conflict, Rob often retreats back to his own nest, according to the publication.
And considering Blac and Rob’s often volatile and unpredictable relationship, we think this arrangement is pretty healthy! But we love how the two aren’t giving up hope either. After all, the media outlet has allegedly learned that the reality TV duo are set to begin looking for houses TOGETHER once their first child together is born. SO sweet!
Tell us, HollywoodLifers — do you think Blac and Rob have figured out a great living arrangement for their little one? Does this make the most sense?

f98624cd,http://www.morningledger.com/dallas-cowboys-trading-tony-romo/13114156/,Dallas Cowboys Trading Tony Romo To The Denver Broncos - Here's Why,"Tony Romo of the Dallas CowboysPhoto: NFL.com
With week 7 of the NFL season coming around the corner, the Dallas Cowboys sit atop the NFC East with a 5-1 record. However, that hasn’t stopped the team from exploring their options in terms of roster improvement, and first on this list seems to be trading away Tony Romo. The 36-year old quarterback is now being looked at as a piece that can be moved comfortably – at least while Dak Prescott is ready to go – and it seems like the Denver Broncos have emerged as a potential partner in that deal.
The defending Superbowl champions came roaring out of the gate for a while, notching four straight victories, but they have hit a bit of a stumble over their last two matches. Now they are looking at a 4-2 record, good for 2nd in the ACF West. Still, the Broncos need to shore up on that quarterback position if they want to improve their chances at another Superbowl victory. Austin Davis and Paxton Lynch have done a fair job so far, but the reality is that they might not be enough. The promising Trevor Siemian has been a bit of a question since the injury that sidelined him.
Even if the Broncos were completely healthy, they’re not likely to get their hands on back-to-back crowns without an experienced quarterback. Who better to fill in than the 13-year veteran Romo?
Trevor Siemian of the Denver Broncos Photo: NFL.com
Given the upside of Trevor Siemian, a Romo-Siemian deal between the Dallas Cowboys and the Denver Broncos looks like a serious possibility. The teams need to think fast, however: The NFL trade deadline is on November 1, looming just around the corner.
Other teams have been brought up in the conversations involving Romo’s possible destinations. Colin Cowherd of Fox Sports think that the New York Jets would be the right team for the Dallas Cowboys to trade with, and getting Ryan Fitzpatrick could make them think about it. The Chicago Bears, who have continued their habit of being pretty bad in the league right now, could make a serious stride by acquiring Romo as well.
With the first half of the season in the record books, fans will be waiting to see where Romo goes. We know that he’s going to help a team with their aspirations on moving onward and upward; the remaining question is, where?

Things went the other way, though, and the Dolphins closed with a convincing win over their AFC East rivals. The Dolphins scored three touchdowns and their defense shut down the Bills for most of the final 20 minutes to emerge with a 28-25 victory.
Reggie Bush scored a touchdown with 14 seconds left to play to cut the Dolphins lead down from 11 points, but the Dolphins recovered the onside kick to ice their third win of the year.
Jay Ajayi did a lot of the heavy lifting on offense for the Dolphins as he ran for 214 yards and a touchdown while becoming the fourth player in NFL history to run for 200 yards in back-to-back games. Ajayi set up the go-ahead touchdown with a 14-yard run before leaving the game briefly, but came back before the day was out and appeared to be fine.
Ryan Tannehill put the finishing touches on the win by hitting wide receiver Kenny Stills for a 66-yard touchdown with a little more than two minutes left to play in the game. Tannehill was 15-of-25 for 198 yards overall and converted several key third downs through the air over the course of the afternoon.
Tyrod Taylor couldn’t do the same for the Bills. He hit Marquise Goodwin for a 67-yard touchdown in the third quarter and converted short fields into 10 first-half points, but the Bills couldn’t consistently move the ball. LeSean McCoy left after his hamstring flared up and the Bills ended the afternoon with 67 rushing yards and just 267 yards overall with 75 of those yards coming once the Bills were already down 11 in the fourth quarter.
The Bills had been hot on the ground heading into Miami, but the Dolphins defense was in fine form Sunday. Ndamukong Suh had a sack and three quarterback hits, Mario Williams was active in both phases against his former team and Cameron Wake added 1.5 more sacks of Taylor

Everyone loves a Thunderbolt.
Today's A-10 Thunderbolt II, also known as the Warthog, is possibly the most beloved aircraft in the U.S. arsenal, or at least it is to American ground troops (to the Air Force brass, the Thunderbolt is a Thunderpain).
But 75 years ago, there was another Thunderbolt. It, too, was a scrappy brawler of an warplane.
At first glance, there is little family resemblance between the two planes The P-47 Thunderbolt of the Second World War was a fast, high-altitude fighter designed to battle the Luftwaffe for control of European skies. The A-10 Thunderbolt II is a low-altitude ground attack aircraft originally designed to shoot up Soviet tanks during the Cold War.
Yet both aircraft have a lot in common. Not to be uncharitable, but both Thunderbolts are as aerodynamically ugly as flying pigs. The P-47 was affectionately nicknamed ""the Jug"" (short for ""juggernaut""), perhaps a nod to its beefy, thick-bodied fuselage. Compared to a svelte five-ton P-51 Mustang or a three-ton Spitfire, the seven-ton Jug resembled a flying truck. And the A-10, with its engines mounted above the tail and a big cannon sticking out the nose like a case of aerial acne? Only a mother airplane could find the ""Warthog"" handsome.
But, of course, both Thunderbolts had the same father. The P-47 was built by Republic Aircraft. Republic was acquired in 1965 by Fairchild, which became Fairchild Republic, manufacturer of the A-10.
The Thunderbolt brothers were famous for their ability to dish out a huge amount of firepower. Armed with eight .50-caliber machine guns, the P-47 packed a devastating punch. The A-10's 30-millimeter cannon with depleted-uranium shells made mincemeat out of Iraqi tanks in the First Gulf War.
Both aircraft could also absorb incredible amounts of damage. The P-47 was legendary for its tough construction and large, armored cockpit. “Even with its complicated turbo supercharger system, its sturdy airframe and tough radial engine could absorb a lot of damage and still return home,” wrote historian Cornelius Ryan in “A Bridge Too Far.” “Some pilots readily chose to belly-land their burning Thunderbolts rather than risk bailing out; there are instances of P-47s crash-landing after being shot down, hitting trees and absorbing impacts severe enough to snap off wings, tail, and engine, while the pilot escaped with few or no injuries.”
While the P-47 could take a pounding, the A-10 positively relished it. Designed to survive the dense cocoon of anti-aircraft missiles and guns that would protected Soviet tank columns blitzing into Western Europe, the Warthog was built to take hits that would easily down a sleek F-15 or F-16 fighter. The cockpit is encased in titanium that can resist cannon fire, there are redundant hydraulic flight controls (with mechanical backup in case the hydraulics fail), and the engines mounted above the tail produce less of an infrared trail for ground-launched heat-seeking missiles to home in on. On top of which, there is something scary about an airplane that is expressly designed to make it back home minus half a wing.
Both Thunderbolts also share a reputation as deadly ground attack aircraft. The A-10 destroyed 23 tanks in one day. More surprising was the P-47, which was actually a formidable air combat fighter that accounted for more than 3,000 Axis aircraft. Its rate of climb wasn't impressive, nor its low-altitude maneuverability, but the heavy Jug was so relentless in a dive that German aircraft often couldn't escape a P-47 on their tail.
But the Jug really came into its own as the premier U.S. fighter-bomber in Europe. Armed with bombs, 5-inch air-to-ground rockets and its eight machine guns, the P-47 terrorized German ground forces. From D-Day in June 1944 to Germany's surrender in May 1945, the Jug was credited with destroying 86,000 railway cars, 9,000 locomotives, 6,000 armored fighting vehicles and 68,000 trucks.
Neither Thunderbolt was ever the coolest plane in the hanger. The P-47 lacked the range and the agility of the P-51. Yet the Jug would have its revenge. The U.S. Air Force junked the P-47 after World War II but kept the Mustang, just in time for the Korean War to erupt. With jets like the F-86 handling the air superiority role, the Mustangs were relegated to ground attack missions. Unfortunately, the P-51's more fragile construction and liquid-cooled engine -- which would seize up if damaged -- resulted in heavy losses to Communist flak that the P-47 would certainly have survived.
As for the A-10, its successor may be the F-35 Lightning II. Which you would want to be the pilot of a Lightning that loses half a wing from a cannon shell?
Cool-looking, they're not. But no one messes with a Thunderbolt.

The Orionids meteor shower will appear in the sky during the early hours of Oct. 21, and while it’s expected to be a beautiful show, Doomsday preppers fear the comet’s debris could destroy Earth! Watch a LIVE stream of the space event, here.
Well this is depressing. Doomsday preppers and conspiracy theorists alike predict the world will end tomorrow, as the Orionid meteor shower scatters across our sky. Every 75 years, Halley’s Comet circles our planet (even though it’s usually naked to the eye), leaving behind a trail of debris, known as the Orionid meteor shower. What we can expect to see is a string of what looks like shooting stars running across the sky, which sounds breathtakingly beautiful, except for one minor detail…it’s expected to destroy Earth. WATCH A LIVE STREAM OF THE METEOR SHOWER HERE.
@HISTORY At least the meteor will cause a quick death. Screw that slow dying BS. #Doomsday
— Christopher Stull (@Soldierstull) October 1, 2016
This Doomsday theory stems from the 1555 writings of Nostradamus, a French apothecary who’s prophecies were highly respect at the time. “A fire will fall from the sky which will appear in several countries and will burn some palace: the fire will be great,” he wrote. “At the end of this Moon and one part of another, one will doubt in several countries the conflagration of Vesuvius of Phaethon to come again one other time.” Yeah, that sounds like gibberish to us, too, but he basically said the world will end during the Orionid shower.
Before you freak out, Nostradamus has been wrong many, many times. The last time we saw Halley’s Comet was in 1986, and nothing terrible happened. Nostradamus’ prophecies are similar to the Mayan prophecy, which predicted the world would end in 2012 as a result of armageddon. Also incorrect. It is said that the event will wipe out the Earth with its earthquakes and tsunamis, which is kind of freaky, considering Hurricane Matthew caused such a ruckus. Seriously, though, don’t worry about dying in a flash of light, just enjoy the show!
HollywoodLifers, do you really think the world win end on Oct. 21?

(AP) — Tim Kaine is shrugging off any possibility that he could be embarrassed by the release of hacked emails.
WikiLeaks, which has been posting stolen emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta, has twice taunted the Democratic vice presidential candidate that he's in for a ""surprise."" U.S. intelligence officials say the leaked Podesta emails are part of a series of high-profile computer hacks of Democratic targets orchestrated by the Russian government.
In an interview with The Associated Press on Saturday in Boston, Kaine said he's a ""regular human being"" and he has nothing to be ""overly embarrassed about.""
Kaine, whose affable nature has led to numerous internet dad jokes since he was tapped by Clinton to be her running mate, said it's not his style to write nasty emails that could come back and haunt him.
""I would say it would not be my norm. I do have a temper so, I mean, I imagine I've got an email or two out there that people might find unusual,"" Kaine said.
He pointed out that thousands of emails from his time as Virginia governor have already been made public and that there's nothing in them that's proved a major embarrassment.
Kaine has routinely questioned the authenticity of WikiLeak's releases and said the emails were hacked as part of an unprecedented effort by the Russian government to try and influence the presidential campaign. Both Russia and WikiLeaks have denied that charge.
It is impossible to authenticate each hacked email that WikiLeaks has published, but Democrats have openly acknowledged they were hacked and have not pointed to any specific case where an email was altered to inflict political damage.
WikiLeaks' taunts appear connected to Kaine questioning the validity of the emails in public. The group taunted Kaine on Sunday after he appeared on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" where he called release of the emails part of a Russian propaganda effort.
Kaine said he's aware he could be prime target of a hostile foreign government, but he's determined not to be distracted in the final days before Election Day.
""I've been very good in my political life of not letting people throw me off my game,"" Kaine said.

The French president then said that Putin put off his trip after Hollande let him know he wouldn't take part in the opening of the new center and was only interested in talks about Syria.
""I am glad that the cathedral and the cultural Russian center have found their place in Paris,"" said Hidalgo, a close ally to Hollande. ""A place that signifies the friendship between people."" Among the Russian dignitaries who attended Wednesday's ceremony was Russia's ambassador to France Alexander Orlov.
The complex, including the Holy Trinity Cathedral, has been built on the site of the former headquarters of France's national weather forecasting service, near the Seine River. The site, which also includes a school and a book shop, was sold to Russia under former President Nicolas Sarkozy's government amid criticism from rights groups about France's outreach to Putin.
The Russian president visited the site in 2010 and denied reports it would be used by Russian secret services. The church was designed by French architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte and features five onion-shaped golden domes. The biggest one weighs eight tons and is 12 meters (40 feet) high.

1031c208,https://www.rt.com/news/363517-us-tanks-deployment-korea/,"US deploys 3,500-strong armored brigade to S. Korea amid mounting tensions with North"," The 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, one of the oldest tank units in the US Army, will move to South Korea for a nine-month “rotational deployment.” It comes just one day after the Pentagon threatened an “overwhelming response” to any attack on Seoul. 
The US Army said on Wednesday that it had begun the “rotational deployment” of the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team (1st ABCT) of the 1st Infantry Division from Fort Riley, Kansas, to the Camp Casey north of Seoul.
Brigade General Patrick D. Frank, deputy commander of the 1st Infantry Division, said in a statement the brigade’s 3,500 soldiers and officers “are well-trained and fully prepared for this important mission to South Korea” that would last for nine months. 
A typical Armored Brigade Combat Team in the US Army includes 90 M1 Abrams tanks, 90 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, and 112 M113 armed personnel carriers. Other vehicles, such as ‘Humvees’, operate in a supporting role.

The US military refrained from providing more details of the deployment, but it comes amidst the latest of “North Korea’s provocations.”
On Wednesday, the US Defense Secretary Ash Carter told his South Korean counterpart Han Min-goo in Washington that “the US commitment to the defense of South Korea is unwavering.”
“Make no mistake, any attack on America or our allies will not only be defeated, but any use of nuclear weapons will be met with an overwhelming and effective response,” he added.

Among other measures, the two countries will stage a massive two-day military exercise, scheduled to start on October 22.
The war games, meant to train naval intercept operations, will feature South Korea’s Aegis-capable destroyer Yulgok Yi I, USS McCampbell with her support ship USS Tippecanoe as well as P-3 Orion patrol aircraft.
The Japanese Navy will also send its guided-missile destroyer ‘Ariake’ and an H-60 helicopter.
On Wednesday, US and South Korean defense ministers also discussed a so-called “extended deterrence” which will see stationing of American THAAD ballistic missile defense system in South Korea with a stated goal to respond to North’s rocket launches.
N. Korea threatens US with preemptive nuke strike, promises more tests – N. Korean officialhttps://t.co/BPhtuNajDApic.twitter.com/YXWwxnxBMD
— RT (@RT_com) 17 октября 2016 г. 
Earlier this month, Washington rejected a petition against the move, signed by more than 100,000 people, claiming that the THAAD was a tool to “improve the missile defense posture of the US-[South Korea] alliance” against “North Korea’s continued provocations and refusal to engage in serious negotiations on denuclearization.”
Moscow maintains that tensions between Seoul and Pyongyang must be resolved through political dialogue and not by military means, arguing that deployment of missile defense systems in South Korea would inevitably affect security in the entire region.
Pyongyang has threatened the US and its ally South Korea with a “pre-emptive nuclear strike.” According to Lee Yong-pil, a director of the North Korean Foreign Ministry’s Institute for American Studies, the US has no monopoly on preventive nuclear attacks.
“We have to have nuclear weapons to protect our country, and it’s our policy to go nuclear,” the official said.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have been running high since the beginning of this year, when North Korea has been massive nuclear and ballistic missile tests in defiance of UN resolutions.

43d69091,http://wbay.com/2016/10/23/police-man-in-deadly-appleton-shooting-may-have-suffered-from-mental-health-issues/,Police: Man in deadly Appleton shooting may have suffered from mental health issues,"Appleton, Wis. (WBAY) – Police have released a few more details on a deadly shooting involving two brothers in Appleton Saturday night.
The Appleton Police Department said Sunday afternoon that the incident on the 800 block of N. Oneida Street was a domestic violence situation. It involved two brothers ages 24 and 21 who lived together.
Officials say a lengthy verbal argument between the two brothers led to the 21-year-old shooting his 24-year-old brother in the leg.
The 24-year-old man fled the home after being shot. Police say the 21-year-old then shot himself with the same weapon. The self-inflicted gunshot was witnessed by a family member.
The younger brother who shot himself was pronounced dead at the hospital. The 24-year-old man was treated but has since been released from the hospital.
According to police, their investigation shows the 21-year-old brother may have been suffering from mental health issues.
Appleton Police Department wants to remind the community that anyone in need of mental health resources can contact the Crisis Hotline at 920-832-4646 or NAMI Fox Valley at 920-954-1550.
Those dealing with domestic violence can contact Harbor House Domestic Abuse for help. They can be reached at 920-832-1666.
This investigation is still ongoing.
An autopsy on the 21-year-old brother who has died is scheduled for Monday.

As the newborn boy cried and screamed the morning of Sept. 21, according to police, his father took him to the balcony of their apartment and began punching him in the torso to quiet the child.
When that didn’t work, the father brought the infant back inside, grabbed the still-crying infant by the arms off the floor and continued punching him, police said in arrest records. 
Blood began to flow from the baby’s nose and mouth, police said, and the child fell silent.
Court charging documents released Thursday morning reveal details in the death of 3-month-old Antoine Flemons, who Prince George’s County Police said was fatally assaulted by his father before being buried in the woods by his parents. 
The records also indicate that after the baby did not rouse after the assault, his parents left him in their parked 1998 Lincoln Town Car for 24 hours before driving his body to the back of a high school and burying him in a shallow grave. 
The boy remained covered in dirt for several weeks before police unearthed him the morning of Oct. 19 and charged Antoine Petty, 32, and Geneice Petty, 24, in the infant’s death. 
Family members reported the baby missing Monday, but the child had been dead for nearly a month before detectives tracked down the couple and were lead to his burial site behind Parkdale High School in Riverdale, according to police. 
After the baby’s birth, the couple would tell relatives that the child was with others or offer different explanations for his whereabouts when he wasn’t present, said Lt. Dave Coleman, a spokesman for Prince George’s County Police.
Antoine Petty has been charged with first- and second-degree murder and other related charges. Police charged Geneice Petty with being an accessory after the fact. 
Antoine Petty is being held without the possibility of bail and Geneice Petty is being held on a $120,000 bond, according to the Prince George’s County State’s Attorney’s Office. A bail review hearing is scheduled for the couple Friday.
Online court records do not indicate if the Pettys yet have attorneys. A woman inside the couple’s Greenbelt apartment declined to comment to a reporter who knocked on the door Thursday morning.
“It’s heartbreaking, and it’s horrifying,” Coleman said Wednesday of the allegations. “Everyone who sees this is so sad for the child and everyone involved.”
A review of online court records indicate that Antoine Petty has been charged with various crimes, including theft and assault, and has a record going back to at least 2002.
In 2014, Prince George’s police featured him as a suspect in the department’s regular “Wanted Wednesday” blog, which made national news when the posting also included a mug shot that showed his extensive facial tattoos. Detectives in the 2014 alert were searching for Antoine Petty on what said was suspicion of stealing a gun from an acquaintance in Largo.

8f9f28c3,https://sodiumbreakup.heart.org/how_much_sodium_should_i_eat,How much sodium should I eat per day?,"What should my daily sodium intake be?
For optimal heart-health, the American Heart Association recommends people aim to eat no more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day. That level is associated with a significant reduction in blood pressure, which in turn reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke.
Because the average American’s sodium intake is so excessive, even cutting back to no more than 2,400 milligrams a day will significantly improve blood pressure and heart health.
More than 75 percent of the sodium Americans eat comes from some processed, prepackaged and restaurant foods – not from the salt shaker.
Here are the approximate amounts of sodium in a given amount of table salt:
1/4 teaspoon salt = 575 mg sodium
1/2 teaspoon salt = 1,150 mg sodium
3/4 teaspoon salt = 1,725 mg sodium
1 teaspoon salt = 2,300 mg sodium
Did you know that on average, Americans eat more than 3,400 milligrams of sodium each day — much more than the American Heart Association and other health organizations recommend? Most of us are likely underestimating how much sodium we eat, if we can estimate it at all. The association surveyed 1,000 adults and found that one-third couldn’t estimate how much sodium they ate, and another 54 percent thought they were eating less than 2,000 mg sodium a day.
Keeping sodium in check is part of the overall heart-healthy eating pattern that the American Heart Association recommends. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables and whole grains, while including low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish and nuts, and limiting red meat, sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages. Following this pattern should help you limit not only the sodium you eat but also the saturated fat andtrans fat you eat.
The guideline to reduce to 1,500 mg doesn’t apply to people who lose big amounts of sodium in sweat, like competitive athletes, and workers exposed to major heat stress, such as foundry workers and fire fighters, or to those directed otherwise by their healthcare provider. If you have a medical conditions or other special dietary needs or restrictions, you should follow the advice of a qualified healthcare professional.
 How can I tell how much sodium I’m eating?
You can find the amount of sodium in your food by looking at the Nutrition Facts label. The amount of sodium per serving is listed in milligrams, abbreviated “mg.” Check the ingredient list for words like sodium, salt and soda. The total sodium shown on the Nutrition Facts label includes the sodium from salt, plus the sodium from any other sodium-containing ingredient in the product (for example, ingredients like sodium nitrate, sodium citrate, monosodium glutamate [MSG], or sodium benzoate).
Remember to take note of the serving size on the Nutrition Facts label. If your portion size equals two servings of a product, you’re actually eating double the sodium listed.
Here are sodium-related terms you may see on food packages:
 Sodium-free – Less than 5 milligrams of sodium per serving and contains no sodium chloride
 Very low sodium – 35 milligrams or less per serving
 Low sodium – 140 milligrams or less per serving
 Reduced (or less) sodium – At least 25 percent less sodium per serving than the usual sodium level
 Light (for sodium-reduced products – If the food is “low calorie” and “low fat” and sodium is reduced by at least 50 percent per serving
 Light in sodium – If sodium is reduced by at least 50 percent per serving
Check out our handy sodium tracker to help you keep tabs on how much sodium you’re eating. Just jot down what you eat — that blueberry muffin for breakfast, or the garlic bread with last night’s spaghetti — and the accompanying sodium stats. Remember: Sodium levels vary in the same foods depending on the brand or restaurant.
At the end of the day it’s easy to tally how much sodium you consumed so you can make better choices as needed. Sometimes a small adjustment can bring big results when it comes to your health! Keep exploring this website and our blog, the Salty Scoop, for tips.
Is there such a thing as eating too little sodium?
The body needs only a small amount of sodium (less than 500 milligrams per day) to function properly. That’s a mere smidgen — the amount in less than ¼ teaspoon. Practically no one in this country even comes close to eating less than that amount. Plus, healthy kidneys are great at retaining the sodium that our bodies need.
There’s no reliable evidence that eating less than 1,500 mg per day of sodium is a risk for the general population. There is some evidence that this may be harmful to certain patients with congestive heart failure, but those people make up only a small part of the population.

844b3e64,http://okmagazine.com/get-scoop/kourtney-kardashian-hot-mess-kim-hires-sobriety-coach/,Out Of Kontrol! Kourtney Kardashian Is A 'Hot MESS' & Kim Is Trying To Save Her Before It's Too Late!,"Kourtney Kardashian may be concerned about Scott Disick’s love for the nightlife, but her family is more concerned abut her growing interest in the party scene because it’s getting out of control!
A source told OK! “Kim just can’t sit back and watch Kourtney destroy herself. She’s out every single night and she’s become a hot mess.” That certainly doesn’t sound good, but if anyone can help, it’s Kim. The reality star has been outspoken about not liking to drink and is rarely photographed out at a club, unless it’s 1 OAK for her annual birthday bash.
But Kim may want to change her approach, because she ended up making Kourt upset with her tactics!
An insider revealed Kim hired her older sister a sobriety coach “but it didn’t go down well.” Part of the reason is that Kourtney doesn’t think she has a problem.
“Kourtney thinks she’s earned the right to let loose for a while, after holding that family together for so long. She’s put everyone first except herself and now that’s changing, but Kim insists she’s out of control,” a source said. As fans know, Kourtney’s been dealing with Scott’s problems for years, and his drinking and late nights out led to his relationship failing.
However, Kourtney may be taking things too far. The insider added that Kim “wants her to slow down before it becomes a habit. She makes Scott’s mid-life crisis look like a kids’ tea party.” And that’s saying a lot!

Mike Crapo has a really odd name, but one that is also hard to make fun of.
In the hours after Donald Trump was revealed to have boasted that he would kiss women and “grab them by the pussy” without their consent, Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo was one of the earliest of a number of Republican political leaders to revoke their support for the GOP presidential nominee.
“This is not a decision that I have reached lightly, but his pattern of behavior has left me no choice,” read a statement announcing Crapo’s apparently principled stand. “His repeated actions and comments toward women have been disrespectful, profane and demeaning.”
Crapo has now had another change of heart. On Monday, Politico reported that Crapo had released another statement stating that he would in fact be voting for Trump.
Again, this stood in stark contrast to his statement earlier this month that indicated he felt that Trump’s now infamous hot mic moment in 2005 was more than just “locker room talk,” the excuse the candidate has stuck by even as a flood of accusers have come forward to say they were attacked by Trump in exactly the way he described.
“I have spent more than two decades working on domestic violence prevention,” Crapo said at the time of his un-endorsement. “Trump’s most recent excuse of ‘locker room talk’ is completely unacceptable and is inconsistent with protecting women from abusive, disparaging treatment.”
There has been no public polling of the Senate race in Idaho, a deep red state that hasn’t elected a Democratic Senator since 1974. The three-term Republican incumbent is running against businessman Jerry Sturgill for a seat that electoral prognosticator and academic Larry J. Sabato has continued to list as “safe” for Crapo and the GOP. It’s possible that Crapo felt squeezed by Republican voters that still strongly back Trump and more moderate voters who have been turned off by the assault talk and accusations, and opted to go with the base. Still, it’s hard to say what’s behind Crapo’s sudden shift. The move does seem especially craven, though, given what should be a solid Crapo seat.
One thing’s for sure, there should be some sort of expression for what Crapo has been doing this election cycle that might also serve as an interesting play on his very unusual name. But it’s really, really hard to think of one.
I mean, what do you call someone who promises one thing based on what he claims are sincerely held beliefs and then does the exact opposite thing?
Or if only there was an idiom for someone who struggles to conclusively make up his mind on a matter for an absurd period of time?
Anyways, if you can think of ways to describe Mike Crapo’s indecision that also might serve as a fun bit of wordplay, please leave them in the comments below, because we are at a complete loss.

A Muslim man in Norway has been detained for raping his daughter as a punishment after she became ‘too Western’.
The man, in his 40s has been charged with rape and incest after he attacked his daughter in their family home in the city of Fredrikstad.
Police prosecutors have said the daughter told officers she was raped by her father as a punishment for living a Western lifestyle.
 Both the father and daughter are of a non-European background.
Police lawyer Anette Sogn told Fredrikstad24: ‘They had been arguing prior to the rape. ‘The father has been angry because his daughter did not follow his (Islamic) way of life, she explained in questioning.’
Following the attack, the daughter, who is in her 20s, ran out of the house and told a passing postman what had happened, who then went to the police.
The father has reportedly claimed that he does not understand why he has been charged with the crimes and said he was shocked by police DNA results.
The man has acknowledged that he sat on the victim’s bed, and tried to explain the police DNA findings with indirect contact.
If convicted, the man is likely to face a tough punishment in the courts, due to the gravity of the attack upon the victim in her own home.
 The victim is receiving psychiatric help following the ordeal.

Attorneys for Katie McLaughlin, Fogle's ex-wife, filed a lawsuit against Subway on her behalf in Hamilton Superior Court in Noblesville, Ind., on Monday. Fogle, 39, is serving nearly 16 years in a federal prison after his conviction on child pornography charges.

Jared Fogle, a former pitchman for Subway, is escorted to a car by police after pleading guilty on ...

Jared Fogle, a former pitchman for Subway, is escorted to a car by police after pleading guilty on Wednesday, Aug. 19, 2015, to charges of child pornography and having sex with minors, according to court documents. Fogle was sentenced Nov. 19, 2015, to more than 15 years in the case.

""I filed this lawsuit because I have questions,"" said McLaughlin.

McLaughlin said her main focus in getting answers about what Subway knew when. But she is requesting an unspecified amount of damages.

On at least three occasions Subway, received reports about Fogle's sexual interest in children. Subway officials investigated, but took no action, the suit claims.

Subway turned Jared's family into a marketing tool, the suit says, and used likenesses without their consent.

""Subway's ambition for sales and growth"" came at the expense of his wife and children, the suit alleges.

As early as 2004, Subway's senior vice president of marketing was told that Fogle approached a young girl for a sex act at a Las Vegas Subway event. Subway sent a public relations manger to ask Fogle and a franchisee about the incident. Subway did not contact the girl and did nothing more, the suit alleges.

First a household name because of his story of extreme weight loss, Fogle last year became known instead for his exploitation of children and use of child pornography.

A federal judge in November sentenced him to 15 years and eight months in prison after he pleaded guilty to possession or distribution of child pornography and traveling across state lines to have commercial sex with a minor.

The case became a national media story in July 2015 when law enforcement officers raided Fogle's Zionsville, Ind., home.

Last week, an underage Indiana girl who was secretly filmed via hidden cameras by Russell Taylor, the former head of the Jared Fogle Foundation, who then shared those images with Fogle, dropped the lawsuit that was filed against the pair in March.

After law enforcement officials raided Fogle's home, Subway said it and Fogle were ""suspending their relationship"" because of the probe. Earlier in the day the company said it was ""shocked"" over the news. By the end of July 7, 2015, it had pulled a page on Fogle from its website. When reports surfaced about Fogle's plea deal in August 2015, the sandwich chain sent out a tweet saying ""We no longer have a relationship with Jared and have no further comment.""

Fogle's rise as a sandwich spokesman turned the Hoosier into a celebrity. He was a 425-pound freshman at Indiana University when he embarked on an unusual diet of turkey and veggie subs in 1998. After losing 235 pounds he began to appear in television commercials for Subway.

He starred in more than 300 Subway commercials, appeared in numerous television shows and movies, wrote an autobiographical book and pulled in $5,000 to $10,000 for personal appearances.

Since Tyga discovered Blac Chyna’s newly bought Rolls Royce Wraith, he seems jealous of it.
Recently, Kylie bought Tyga a Bentley after his Ferrari was taken by a man with a spare key on August 30. Apparently, Tyga does not like his Bentley anymore.
 In an interview with TMZ, Chyna recently bought a $400,000 worth of Rolls Royce. She first showed her new wheels on Snapchat, posting a video of her driving the vehicle.
She chose a purple-trimmed interior for her car so that it would match the purple Lamborghini that her husband Rob gave her. However, rumors say that it was Rob who bought the new car.
“It’s lovely right? Seeing as I have my purple Lamborghini, I wanted to match [with the interior]. It’s a limited edition,” she said in the interview.
According to Hollywood Life, everytime Tyga sees Chyna’s new car, he begs Kylie Jenner to buy him the same vehicle his ex has.
Tyga seems to hate his ex girlfriend for having the cool Rolls Royce. He hints at Kylie that while he likes his Bentley, he also wants to have the Rolls. Now, he is convincing Kylie to go to the dealer for a test drive of the said car.
Fans should know that Kylie seems to give in to Tyga’s wants every time. It would not be a surprise if Tyga drives a Rolls Royce one day.
It seems that some fans are not happy with the rumor since Tyga is so obsessed with cars. He should be buying the ones he can only afford.
Stay tuned for more Kylie Jenner Tyga updates!

Media reporters have long speculated on Smith’s sexuality, and several years ago Gawker reported that Fox News executives allegedly prevented Smith from coming out as homosexual—a charge that was denied. Asked by the Huffington Post if recently deposed Fox chief Roger Ailes ever used homophobic slurs around him—a gay man—Smith said, “No, never. He treated me with respect, just respect... he gave me every opportunity in the world and he never asked anything of me but that we get it right, try to get it right every day. It was a very warm and loving and comfortable place.” Smith also directly addressed the Gawker report, saying it was “not true,” and that Ailes “was as nice as he could be to me. I loved him like a father.” However, he said, regarding the rampant sexual-harassment allegations that forced Ailes out the door, Smith said, “[T]rusts were betrayed. People outside this company can’t know [how painful that betrayal was]. This place has its enemies, but inside, it was very personal, and very scarring and horrifying.”","sexual,smith,fox,huffington,shepard,shepard smith,address,respect,smith sexual,smith publicli"

Grab your telescope.
Sure, we all know what eclipses are, but have you ever heard of a lunar occultation? This is what they call it when a star vanishes behind the moon and then reappears as the moon continues its cycle.
There are two types of occultations: grazing and total. A total occultation is when the entire star passes behind the moon. A grazing occultation is when the star looks like it's sliding along the edge of the moon. Tonight, one of the brightest stars in our sky, Aldebaran, will be part of a total occultation.
This spectacle can best be seen from the United States and Canada, according to Space.com. The star will begin to disappear around 10 p.m. PDT, and will reappear roughly 75 minutes later on the darker side of the moon. You can also follow the lunar occultation on this website, which shows the event's entire path.

Monday was the first day of early voting for the Nov. 8 election in El Paso and throughout Texas. Here are some notes from voting so far.
Stickers!
The ""I Voted"" sticker is a longtime tradition in elections, and this year El Paso County voters are getting a new version that's quite different from the old check-mark stickers.
Turnout
El Paso County Elections Administrator Lisa Wise said turnout for the first day of early voting was going strong, with about 3,000 in-person votes cast by 11 a.m.
Occasional long lines were reported, including Monday morning at Pavo Real Recreation Center in the Lower Valley, historically one of El Paso's busier early voting sites.
Early voters at Pavo Real Recreation Center had to wait through occasional long lines on the first day of early voting.
For some historical context, I looked back at the 2008 and 2012 elections, the last two presidential races.
In 2008, 8,658 El Pasoans came out to vote on the first day of early voting. When combined with 2,155 mail ballots received that first day, a total of 10,813 early votes were recorded.
In 2012, the numbers fell to 8,258 in-person voters and 1,222 mail voters, for a total of 9,480.
So what would be a good first-day turnout for El Paso? How about 10,000 in-person voters and 2,000 mail ballots, for a total of 12,000.
We'll know the actual numbers Tuesday morning. The elections office will update early voting totals from the previous day each morning.
Early voting continues through Nov. 4. Election Day is Nov. 8. You can see a list of early voting sites here.
Info on registered voters
El Paso County has 428,507 registered voters for this election. Almost 266,000 of them -- 62 percent -- did not vote in the 2012 presidential election, according to a quick analysis of the data I conducted this morning. That would include people who registered to vote since the last presidential election, as well as those who were registered but didn't cast ballots. Remember, only 47 percent of El Paso County's registered voters cast ballots in the 2012 election.
That leaves just over 162,000 registered voters who cast ballots in 2012. The total vote that year was 176,146, meaning more than 14,000 El Pasoans who voted in 2012 are no longer registered here. They died or moved away.
Exit pollsters
Students from Coronado High school, led by members of the WE(Fillintheblank) student organization, were conducting exit polls at most early voting sites on Monday. They'll be back out on Saturday, then will be at about a third of the Election Day polling sites.
The WE(Fillintheblank) organization has done a number of civic engagement projects over the years, including debates and student forums. This is their second exit poll, after doing one during the 2012 primaries.
Students from Coronado High School worked on exit poll forms at the County Courthouse Monday.

The students are asking voters about how they voted in the presidential election, and whether they think the country and our community are on the right track.They will provide some fascinating data after the election.
Disclosure: I have provided advice to the We (Fillintheblank) students over the years, including for their current exit poll project.

 This is interesting. After reading this, you’ll never look at a banana in the same way again. Bananas contain three natural sugars – sucrose, fructose and glucose combined with fiber. A banana gives an instant, sustained and substantial boost of energy. Research has proven that just two bananas provide enough energy for a strenuous 90-minute workout. No wonder the banana is the number one fruit with the world’s leading athletes. But energy isn’t the only way a banana can help us keep fit. It can also help overcome or prevent a substantial number of illnesses and conditions, making it a must to add to our daily diet.
 DEPRESSION
 According to a recent survey undertaken by MIND amongst people suffering from depression, many felt much better after eating a banana. This is because bananas contain tryptophan, a type of protein that the body converts into serotonin, known to make you relax, improve your mood and generally make you feel happier. PMS: Forget the pills – eat a banana. The vitamin B6 it contains regulates blood glucose levels, which can affect your mood.
 ANEMIA
 High in iron, bananas can stimulate the production of hemoglobin in the blood and so helps in cases of anemia.
 BLOOD PRESSURE:
 This unique tropical fruit is extremely high in potassium yet low in salt, making it perfect to beat blood pressure So much so, the US Food and Drug Administration has just allowed the banana industry to make official claims for the fruit’s ability to reduce the risk of blood pressure and stroke.
 BRAIN POWER
 200 students at a Twickenham school ( England ) were helped through their exams this year by eating bananas at breakfast, break, and lunch in a bid to boost their brain power. Research has shown that the potassium-packed fruit can assist learning by making pupils more alert.
 CONSTIPATION
 High in fiber, including bananas in the diet can help restore normal bowel action, helping to overcome the problem without resorting to laxatives.
 AdChoices AdChoices 
 HANGOVERS
 One of the quickest ways of curing a hangover is to make a banana milkshake, sweetened with honey. The banana calms the stomach and, with the help of the honey, builds up depleted blood sugar levels, while the milk soothes and re-hydrates your system.
 HEARTBURN
 Bananas have a natural antacid effect in the body, so if you suffer from heartburn, try eating a banana for soothing relief.
 MORNING SICKNESS
 Snacking on bananas between meals helps to keep blood sugar levels up and avoid morning sickness.
 MOSQUITO BITES:
 Before reaching for the insect bite cream, try rubbing the affected area with the inside of a banana skin. Many people find it amazingly successful at reducing swelling and irritation.
 NERVES
 Bananas are high in B vitamins that help calm the nervous system.. Overweight and at work? Studies at the Institute of Psychology in Austria found pressure at work leads to gorging on comfort food like chocolate and chips. Looking at 5,000 hospital patients, researchers found the most obese were more likely to be in high-pressure jobs. The report concluded that, to avoid panic-induced food cravings, we need to control our blood sugar levels by snacking on high carbohydrate foods every two hours to keep levels steady.
 ULCERS
 The banana is used as the dietary food against intestinal disorders because of its soft texture and smoothness. It is the only raw fruit that can be eaten without distress in over-chronicler cases. It also neutralizes over-acidity and reduces irritation by coating the lining of the stomach.
 TEMPERATURE CONTROL
 Many other cultures see bananas as a ‘cooling’ fruit that can lower both the physical and emotional temperature of expectant mothers. In Thailand , for example, pregnant women eat bananas to ensure their baby is born with a cool temperature. So, a banana really is a natural remedy for many ills. When you compare it to an apple, it has FOUR TIMES the protein, TWICE the carbohydrate, THREE TIMES the phosphorus, five times the vitamin A and iron, and twice the other vitamins and minerals.. It is also rich in potassium and is one of the best value foods around So maybe its time to change that well-known phrase so that we say, ‘A BANANA a day keeps the doctor away!’

11b0ab35,http://brobible.com/life/article/great-white-shark-diving-encounter-guadalupe/,A HUGE Great White Busts Into A Diver's Cage And Cuts Off The Oxygen Supply And Somehow The Water Isn't Brown,"Diving with great white sharks is an exhilarating experience for any human no matter how many times they’ve done it. Being in the presence of such incredible size and power is humbling because you’re acutely aware of your mortality, and the fact that at any moment all hell can break loose. That’s precisely what happened during the ‘Bluewater Travel Guadalupe’ group dive in September when a BEHEMOTH great white shark barreled into one of the protective shark/diving cages and cut off one of the diver’s oxygen supplies in the process..The story below is one of the craziest things I’ve ever read in my entire life, so get ready to have your mind blown:
You can see the full image HERE on BlueWaterDiveTravel.com, but here’s what they had to say about this startling encounter:
Less than half way through the dive a female shark approximately 13 – 15 feet long approached Yann and he pushed her away from the cage. A few seconds later, the shark bit the air hose that supplies air from the surface to the divers in the cage, creating an explosion of air bubbles. Yann noticed an immediate loss of air flowing to his regulator, so he descended a few feet down to turn on the one-way valve from the surface supply hose so that the hookah system would not lose pressure. This was done so quickly that neither David, Katie B., nor I experienced a loss of air. While Yann was turning on the valve, the shark swam vertically down into the balcony of the cage, made a sharp turn, and swam right through the bars of the cage. She thrashed around for several seconds and in the process got further lodged into the bars of the cage.
 After about 30 seconds, Katie B. was able to descend down the ladder to the lower part of the cage to join David and me. We stood, gripping the cage in an attempt to stay upright while the cage circled back and forth and at one point was at a 45-degree angle due to the shark’s thrashing. Yann’s regulator had been knocked out of his mouth by the shark, so he retreated to the surface to catch a breath of air and to tell the crew to bring up the cage. I turned on my GoPro just in time to capture the largest shark we had seen, Air Demon AKA “Big Mama,” swimming vertically within a few feet of our cage only seconds after Yann had exited the cage and ascended to the surface. Yann descended back down to the cage, with only the air in his lungs – no hookah, to help us exit the cage and make it safely to the boat. 
It’s hard to put into words the thoughts and feelings that went through my head during this terrifying experience. The first minute or so felt like a horrific earthquake underwater, and I kept thinking, “We just need to wait this out.” But in the back of my head I feared the cage would break apart and this would be the end for me. I was calm, but felt very, very sad. Coincidentally, those were the exact same thoughts that went through David’s head, too.
 Encounters such as this are often sensationalized as man-eating shark attacks. To be clear, this was in no way a shark attack. It was a shark enticed by the scent of tuna, not humans. I suspect (and hope) that this incident prompts some changes in the operations, mainly to the design of the cages so that this cannot happen again.
Getty Image
I can’t help but love how they reiterate repeatedly that this WAS NOT a shark attack, it was just a shark lured in by the scent of delicious tuna.
If it wasn’t clear before, this great white shark encounter was part of a group diving trip to the waters of Guadalupe. The trip was organized by BlueWaterDiveTravel.com, so if you’re interested in taking a trip like this yourself you 100% should look into booking it through them. And if you need some more convincing just head on over to their website for more incredible photos of the trip!

As well as her new boyfriend, it appears Lisa has found a four-legged friend as well!

He said: “She never actually ended it to me. We were just seeing how things went but I saw online that she had dumped me.
“She must have been seeing someone else behind my back. I never knew about it. I thought we were meeting up and texting. I text her a few times and she didn’t reply. I saw her last Monday and by Thursday she had a new man. ”
But it appears Lisa is intending to keep Paul around, and appeared beaming as she messed around outside her home which she’ll share with the glazing salesman.

Lisa recently vowed to The Sun Online that after being on the dole and going bankrupt, she intends to become the UK’s version of Kim Kardashian.
After starting a new gruelling exercise regime under the eyes of her ex, it is not known whether she intends to keep her routine up after their split.
It appears at least the diet is out of the window, as she was spotted gobbling down on a bratwurst during a shopping trip with her new love.

However, despite being caught rolling around naked in the sand at Blackpool and being caught putting her bins out in her pants, she told The Sun: “I’ve been asked if I’m embarrassed being papped with my bits and bum out — why would I be?
“I know I get caught off guard but I don’t mind. This is me. Why would I be embarrassed of being me?”

She added: “The UK needs its own Kim Kardashian and I’m happy to fill that spot and make women realise that life’s too short to take yourself too seriously.
“I’ve got the big womanly bottom and the long dark hair like Kim, but I’m the down-to-earth version.
“I’m always being stopped in the street. If I had a Pound for every time someone told me I look like her I’d be rich.”

Jennifer Lawrence obviously has one of the best bodies in showbiz and the Hunger Games actress was seen showing a bit too much of it.
TMZ has posted a picture of Lawrence wearing a tiny bikini which was tinier than it should have been and the actress suffered a bit of a wardrobe malfunction.

This is not the first time Jennifer Lawrence has suffered a wardrobe malfunction. The actress reportedly showed all in a tiny see-through top while she was in New York City, the Daily Mail has reported. The actress wore an all-black ensemble of black see through blouse, skirt, and a blazer. She teamed them with a pair of black high heels and she walked to the party.
Jennifer Lawrence never shies away from showing off a daring style. The actress wore a $2,000 worth of lingerie at the screening of the La La Land, People magazine had reported.
Lawrence seemed very comfortable with the “underwear as outerwear” trend that seems to have become pretty popular. Do you think she carried it off well? While many would focus on her great body, Jennifer Lawrence has time and again proved her acting abilities as well. That’s one of the reasons she would be seen a very meaty role portraying Zelda Fitzgerald, F Scott Fitzgerald’s wife. This is going to be a very challenging role for the actress and there would be a lot of debate about who could be a better replacement. Do you think Lawrence would be able to take perform well on the screen?
While Jennifer Lawrence is obviously making leaps as an actress, her private life is under scrutiny too. People magazine has said that she is reportedly dating Darren Aronofsky, the director. “They’ve been hanging out and are casually dating,” says a friend of Lawrence’s.

The actress was last dating Chris Martin. She had talked in detail about what she likes in men. She said that she didn’t really have a type, Harper’s Bazaar had reported.
However, she says that people can get intimidated by her and that’s got to affect her social life. Although she says there is no reason why people should feel like that but she “understands” it. “I can feel people sometimes are intimidated by me, but I try to do the best I can to offset that,” she says. “There is zero reason to be intimidated by me. At all. But I also understand it.” One would wonder if it includes men too.
Jennifer Lawrence became a sort of flag bearer for feminists when she asked for equal pay for men and women in Hollywood. On feminism, she says: “I don’t know why that word is so scary to people; it shouldn’t be, because it just means equality. If we are moving forward in a society, you are feeling stronger as a woman, and you want to be taken more seriously. You don’t have to take away the wonderful traits that come with being a woman: We are sensitive. We are pleasers. We’re empathetic. All those things that can keep you from asking for what you want or making mistakes.”
 #jenniferlawrence
A photo posted by Jennifer Lawrence (@jenniferlawrencepx) on Aug 25, 2016 at 1:15am PDT
Raising her voice for equal pay comes more out of the “fairness” factor involved in an employer-employee relationship. “As long as you’re getting what’s fair. You know, I want my employers to be happy. I want to please anyone I’m working for as long as they pay me the appropriate amount. I’ll make them as happy as they want.” It’s true that probably nothing would change even if she speaks out, but Lawrence believes in trying.

7f3319ef,http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2016/10/24/tom-brady-josh-brown-domestic-violence/92667930/,"Patriots QB Tom Brady weighs in on domestic violence, Josh Brown situation with NFL","Tom BRady
Tom Brady received a four-game suspension after a multimillion dollar investigation deemed the New England Patriots quarterback was ““generally aware” of deflating footballs before the 2014 AFC title game. New York Giants kicker Josh Brown received a one-game ban for a domestic violence arrest, a decision made before claims of other incidents were detailed last week.
That dichotomy was brought to Brady’s attention during an interview on a Boston radio station on Monday.
“I think it is the league’s issue,” Brady told WEEI. “Obviously, there is a lot of controversy with that. I’m trying to stay out of all that. I will let them handle it. I think that is their responsibility. I certainly don’t condone any part of domestic violence. I think it is a terrible, terrible thing. I think the league, they have to handle those types of things.”
Brown was put on the commissioner’s exempt list --- basically, paid leave --- on Friday by the NFL, two days after the King County (Wash.) Sheriff's Office released documents where Brown admitted he had ""been physically, emotionally and verbally"" abusive toward his then-wife Molly Brown. The NFL was unable to obtain the information when it imposed the one-game suspension before the start of the regular season.
“I’m just going to stay in my lane,” Brady said. “Like I said, it’s up to them to decide whatever they want to do. I’m just going to try and stay out of any kind of my opinion. I certainly have opinions, I just don’t really care to share them.”
Brady said in the radio interview that it’s a “tragedy” when domestic violence occurs.
“Any type of abuse or bullying of people who can’t defend or fight for themselves, I have no respect for that,” Brady said. “Like I said, the NFL, they claim to take tough stances and this is their situation. This is their situation to deal with. I’ll let them deal with it. I was very fortunate to grow up with sisters, a mother — I condone no part of that. That is absolutely something I would never be apart of or do.”

2084a5e9,http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/10/tara-reid-gets-terrifyingly-tiny/,Tara Reid Gets Terrifyingly Tiny," Tara Reid paraded her tiniest frame ever at a Maxim Halloween party over the weekend, and it would appear that she's sporting her tiniest frame yet. 
 That's saying a lot, considering that Reid has long been in the public eye for being frighteningly frail, but this is even taking it to a whole new level. 
 Check out the video. 
Tara Reid is TOO SKINNY
 Her arm basically disappears at one odd camera angle when she sweeps her lank hair out of her huge eyes. 
 If you didn't think that was scary enough, check out this up-close photo of her head. 
 Her dome is easily twice the size of any other part of her body, and that's ... well, let's just be polite and say ""that's not a good thing."" 
 She's always been pretty thin, but girl looks like she's really going through it these days. 
 Earlier this year, Tara was caught in a postively wasted state on video, rambling and ranting incoherently. 
 While that's generally par for the course, Reid put on some much-needed weight over the years and seemed to be drifting slowly but surely out of hot mess territory. 
 In 2014, things were getting so out of hand that former costar Jason Biggs slammed Tara over her body ... 
 ... Which, to be honest, kind of sucked.
 He said, ""Tara's body, I don't know what's going on with it."" 
 ""I don't think she ever knows what's going on with it,"" he qualified. 
 He laughed, and said, ""No one knows what's going on with Tara's body."" 
 In any case, she used to look like that, up there. 
 And that's a fairly fine way to look if you're Tara Reid. 
 She looked happy, and relatively healthy, and for the most part, off the sauce. 
 But as anybody who knows Tara - or in our case ""knows Tara - her disposition and demeanor are just as unpredictable as her body's weight fluctuations. 
 Whatever's happening, girl, be healthy. 
 We loved American Pie, and the Sharknado franchise, frankly, just wouldn't be the same without you. 
 That being said, girl - take care of yourself. The holidays are fast-approaching, and what better time to indulge and get cozy and do a ""Netflix and chill"" thing? 
 Or perhaps just a ""chill?""

1009bb9f,http://www.unilad.co.uk/video/underwear-model-has-very-unfortunate-wardrobe-malfunction-live-on-tv/,Underwear Model Has Very Unfortunate Wardrobe Malfunction Live On TV,"In the past few months, dozens of models have fallen victim to a wardrobe malfunction live on TV, and unfortunately, this is no exception. 
This poor gal was modelling some underwear for Shapewear live on QVC and despite the incredibly snug fit of the beige and brown set, things were all very conservative, reports The Sun.
However, as the camera does a cheeky zoom into the briefs, it reveals that the beige pants were perhaps a little too snug as the brunette has been plagued by a pretty obvious camel toe.
In all fairness, she kept going like a trooper despite the malfunction – even stretching the waistband with her hand to show just how easy the knickers are to wear.
And to think – nobody would’ve noticed had that cameraman not gone crotch crazy and zoomed in far too close.
Although the incident took place back in January, YouTube channel, BabesOfBritain – a YouTube channel dedicated to showcasing the world of lingerie models – posted the NSFW clip and it seems to be having a resurgence.
Hopefully, in the eight months since the wardrobe malfunction, the model has gotten over her bout of embarrassment…

A Russian woman killed herself and her son because her husband wouldn’t stop “oinking” at her following a botched nose surgery. Anna Ozhigova believed that the nose job only made her nostrils oversized, and her husband’s relentless insults made her even more depressed.
This eventually led to the breakdown of their marriage and fearing that her husband would have sole custody of their 8-year-old son, the 33-year-old mother jumped from her parents’ ninth-floor apartment while clutching the boy.
According to the Mirror, Anna left a note that detailed her reasons for the suicide. Prior to her decision, she had already written to a friend about her woes. She said that the surgeon persuaded her to undergo the surgery because her nose “didn’t suit” her face. The surgeon assured her that he would only alter “just one millimeter.” The change appeared to be drastic.
“I can’t smile. My nostrils are now as big as if I was a pig, and moving apart,” Anna wrote. “My smile is now a frown because he removed muscles above my lip and changed something. My husband is oinking when he sees me.”

She told the friend that she couldn’t accept the fact that she would live like that forever. Anna said that she would go to a psychologist, but it remains unknown if she indeed pushed through with the plan. The friend claims that Anna is terrified that her son would be taken away from her. The suicide note detailed that she only “wanted happiness, kindness, and peace” for the child but that “he’s growing up in anger.”

It isn’t the first time someone has committed suicide because of cosmetic surgeries that have gone awry. In 2013, a former teacher, described by her husband as a “bright, beautiful woman,” did the unthinkable after a simple mole removal treatment at a top cosmetic surgery clinic in Britain.
The Express reported that Victoria Meppen-Walter was found dead with a suicide letter claiming that the surgery left her in severe pain. She even asked her husband to indicate on her headstone that the botched procedure was the reason for her death in order to warn others.
“I would have stayed with you much longer had it not been for that evil man in a private hospital,” her letter read.
The husband also found out that Victoria had written a letter to Swiss clinic Dignitas, which was known for its provision of assisted suicides. In the letter addressed to the clinic’s founder, Victoria talked about the “regular stabbing pain” she had to endure which made living normally impossible.
Victoria’s husband said that the operation only lasted 25 minutes. However, when the scar healed, Victoria started to talk about facial pains.
“She said she was in a lot of pain. She described it as a burning sensation on her face and neck and she would sit there with her head in her hands and her eyes closed. As time went on she became more and more determined to get back at the doctor. She would say ‘I’m going to get that b*****d. He has wrecked my face.'”
Several researchers claim that women who go under the knife are exposed to a higher risk of committing suicide. According to the studies, surgeries do not always lead to satisfaction, which could cause disappointment and self-loathing. Some patients also find themselves caught in a spiral of surgery because of unrealistic expectations.
Many surgeons have started to conduct in-depth interviews with the patients wanting to undergo surgeries. The interviews are done in an attempt to detect personality disorders that may only be worsened by surgeries.

Spotting the disabled car along the side of the road, a passing motorist stopped to offer his assistance. After helping, Trump asked how he could repay the good samaritan. The man asked that Trump send his wife a bouquet of flowers. Trump agreed.
True to his word, the bouquet arrived several weeks later along with a note saying, ""we've paid off your mortgage.""

The Leslie Jones hackers just got owned as she finally speaks out for herself fiercely after her nude pictures leaked on ‘Saturday Night Live’. The comedian slapped the hackers by saying such strong words, ‘If you want to see me naked all you have to do is ask!’
She openly discussed her judgment on SNL’s Weekend Update, “All they did was release some nude pics of me,” Jones furiously said. “Which is nothing because, I don’t know if y’all know this about me, but I ain’t shy.” Jones explained that she was not really affected by the leakage since she is confident with her body. “I keep my porn in a folder labeled ‘porn.’ If you want to see Leslie Jones naked, just ask,” she told the audience. “Just Ask.”
Last August 24, Jones ‘personal possessions were hacked including her passport, driver’s license and her phone. Unfortunately, the hackers had access to her personal gallery and several nude photos were posted to her own personal website.
Before the photos circulate online, the actress’ trustworthy staff quickly knew about the leakage and took the website down. Jones was all out in redeeming herself. No sign of any doubt was traced on her face as she shares her own humiliating life experiences in Saturday Night Live’s skit.
Internet trolls about Jones have been surfacing online since she became a part of the Ghostbusters remake. The actress has been experiencing racism because of trolls that featured her face for fun. As usual, she called this out with her typical ways.
“What I’m trying to say is, if you wanna hurt anybody these days, you’re gonna have to do way more than leak their nudes or call them names—you can’t embarrass me more than I have embarrassed myself. I know all the details, cause I was there,” Jones explained.

I'll put myself in a lot of uncomfortable and potentially embarrassing situations in the name of vanity. I'll lie face-down on a table for a 60-minute butt facial (and I'll do it a second time with an electric-muscle-stimulation add-on). I'll get Botox on Facebook Live as thousands of trolls comment (and tell me that my skin is oily and that I'm ruining my life). I'll power through filler injections in-between fainting spells, because cheekbones. I'll even write about my weird skin-care habit and deal with the awkwardness that arises after a first date says, ""Did you know the first thing that comes up when someone googles you is that story about masking your vagina?""
But we all draw a line somewhere — and mine is at the Brazilian wax. I've never gotten a professional one, and I never plan to. (I've never gotten a bikini wax, either, if we're getting into specifics here.) It has nothing to do with not wanting to be hairless or a fear of pain (in fact, I've semi-mastered the at-home wax on myself), and absolutely everything to do with anxiety. 
The thing is, I'm not a naked person. I admire women who take off their tops in the locker room without facing the wall, but I will never be one of them. When I think about going into a salon, taking off my underwear, spreading my legs, and letting someone rip hairs off my labia — under fluorescent lights! — I actually start to feel lightheaded and panicky. Gah, I need a drink of water just typing it...
People say the same thing about aestheticians as they do about gynecologists: ""They've seen a million vaginas — they don't care about yours!"" Which, of course, I know. But just because the waxer — and millions of other women — don't think it's the most intimate thing in the world doesn't change the fact that I do. The detail that really puts the nail in the coffin? The between-the-cheeks portion of the event. Call me a prude: I'm staunchly against showing that part of my body if there's not a parole officer forcing me to. For me, that's an after-marriage move. ""But that's the best thing about a Brazilian!"" says one R29 beauty editor. ""OMG, I live for that!"" says another friend.
Look, I envy you people, I really do. Do you think I don't want one of the perfectly waxed assholes Maya Rudolph yells about in Bridesmaids? Of course I do! Do you think it's fun chafing my hands as I frantically rub wax strip after wax strip trying to do it at home? It is not. Sitting butterfly-style on a towel in front of the mirror isn't my ideal Saturday night, but it's the price I'm willing to pay to keep my dignity intact.

6b283839,http://jamaica-star.com/article/tell-me-pastor/20161021/my-mother-loves-my-boyfriend,My mother loves my boyfriend,"Dear Pastor,
I am 23 years old and my boyfriend is the same age. I can say that we are in love. When I first met him, I did not love him at all. He was too show-off.
He was always wearing tight pants and everything had to match. But I noticed that other girls admired him, so I decided to give him a try.
The first time we kissed, I realised he didn't have much experience. He told me that he had made out with only a couple of girls.
One evening I took a whole hour to teach him what to do. He asked me where I learned to do these things and I told him nobody taught me.
Pastor, he is very bright. I didn't get a good grade in math, so he helped me and I got a two.
He is still living at home and I am also living at home. My parents love him and my mother is hard to please. When I invited him home, he came well dressed, still dressed in tight pants with everything to match. My mother loved that.
ASKED HIM QUESTIONS
My mother is a medical doctor and she asked him all types of medical questions, including whether he is having sex with other women, and he answered them all. I was embarrassed because she did it in my presence. I was upset, but didn't show it.
My mother told me that she did not want him to lie to me, so that is why she asked him these questions in my presence.
She did not ask him if we were having sex. I would have died on the spot if she had asked him that. In talking about him, my mother said that she knows him more than I think.
He is working and going to school at the same time. I am not good at books. I don't like books. I do things with my hands. My aim is to be an architect.
People say that I am beautiful. I feel that way, too. His parents love me, but they are divorced. He gets along with both of them. He is even talking about getting married in the next five years.
My mother says that that is a good time because by that time, I would know whether or not we are really in love with each other.
We had sex for the first time on Valentine's Day. It happened at my house because my parents were away for the weekend. Both of us fell asleep after having sex, but in the middle of the night when he woke up, he went home because he has never slept out. I was impressed with that.
DON'T WANT TO PLAY AROUND
 This is the second guy I was having sex with and I don't want to play around with any other man.
When we were finished having sex and I asked him how he was feeling, he said, ""Couldn't be better, you are my wife"". Pastor, why did he say that?
I had promised myself never to tell a man I had sex, but I did say to him while we were in bed that I am not a virgin. Pastor, do you think I am bad?
S.E.
Dear S.E.,
I do not consider you a bad girl. But I want to discourage you from going from man to man. Your present boyfriend seems to come from a good family and is trained. He has manners and knows how to carry himself well.
I am glad your mother likes him; and your side of the family like him, too.
Your mother knew what type of questions to ask this young man. If he did not answer them well, she would have told you. She knows that his sexual history is important. She doesn't want you to be infected by any STIs. She is a wise doctor. She didn't want this young man to lie to you. That is why she questioned him in your presence.
I beg you, keep your head high. You know what you would like to be in a few years. Pursue your goals and objectives.
I don't expect you to throw yourself around. If you do, you would be throwing away a good relationship with this guy. I wish both of you well.
Pastor

The Orionid meteor shower will dazzle skywatchers for a second night tonight, as the shower reaches its peak.
The meteor shower is produced by the well-known Halley's Comet, officially called 1P/Halley, which is the most recognised of the short-period comets. It is visible from Earth every 75 to 76 years. Essentially, Halley is the parent body of the Orionids.
When the comet passes through the solar system, it leaves a trail of debris through space. The Earth passes through these debris trails and the particles collide with our atmosphere where they disintegrate and burn up, creating flashes of light across the sky. The Orionid meteor shower appears annually in late October.
The meteor shower is given its name as the meteors appear to be originating from the constellation Orion, located on the celestial equator. Named after the Greek mythology hunter Orion, the constellation is one of the most recognisable and visible in the night sky.
Halley is the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime. It last appeared in the inner Solar System in 1986 and is due to reappear in mid-2061.
The comet's visits have been recorded by astronomers since around 240BC, detailed by Chinese, medieval European and Babylonian scientists. However, the appearances were not recognised as returns by the same comet. The periodicity of the comet was first documented by 1705, by the English astronomer Edmond Halley.
Halley's Comet was captured on camera for the first time in 1910, when it passed by around 13.9 million miles (22.4 million km) from Earth, which is about 1/15 the distance between Earth and the Sun.
In 1986, Halley became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft, revealing the structure of a comet nucleus.
For the best chance of seeing a meteor shower, find an area with little light pollution. You can find out the best spots to watch the meteor shower here.

However, it wasn’t until she delivered Zak, 14 weeks early, that she saw how extreme his condition actually was.

Zak Jacob Coates was born with the rarest form of cleft lip and palate, known as Tessier Type 4. The right side of his face was completely disfigured. He suffered cerebral bleeding and heart problems, is blind in his right eye and has no cheekbones in the right side of his face, no nostrils, no lips, and no bottom eyelid.

Doctors didn’t know if Zak would survive his first few weeks at the hospital, but after two weeks, Joanne was finally able to take him home.

Not only did Zak’s condition mean potentially lifelong health issues, but the bullying became a common side effect of his facial disfigurement.

Every day, Joanne watched people stare and point at Zak, and he was even been branded a “monster” by complete strangers.

But as Zak grew older, she realized he developed an unbelievable reaction to the cruelty he faced…

Zak Jacob Coates was born 14 weeks early in his England hometown. His mother, Joanne, knew he had a facial disfigurement when she was pregnant with him, but she didn’t know how severe it actually was until he was born.

Joanne was stunned to discover the entire right side of Zak’s face was disfigured.

That’s because the little boy was born with the rarest form of cleft lip and palate, known as Tessier Type 4.

Doctors said was the worst case they had ever seen.

Weighing in at just two pounds, Zak was kept in an incubator until he was strong enough to go home with Joanne.

He had no cheekbones in the right side of his face, no nostrils, no lips and no bottom eyelid.

Doctors told Joanne that if he did survive, he probably would not be able to live a “normal” life.

His health issues went beyond his facial disfigurement.

With cerebral bleeding and heart problems, the next four months were touch-and-go.

Despite the fact Joanne and Zak knew he would need many operations over the course of his life — and that he is blind in one eye — the little boy proved to be a fighter who never stopped smiling.

Along with Zak’s facial disfigurement has come a lot of unfortunate bullying. Joanne says people constantly stare and point at her son. He has even been branded a “monster” by strangers.

Zak has good friends at school who have no problem defending him, but he doesn’t necessarily need them to. This incredible child has learned how to deal with bullies in the most mature way.

Whenever someone points or laughs, Zak smiles, approaches the bully and says, “I have a cleft lip and I’m blind in one eye, why are you looking at me?”

He also asks anyone interested if they’d like to know more about his condition.

Today, Zak is 10 years old and has undergone at least 28 hours of surgery.

Surpassing the doctor’s expectations, he can eat, speak and drink completely on his own. He dreams of one day becoming an historian.

Joanne says his humor and confidence has contributed to his overall strength in both mind and body.

The group were seen stumbling out of the London restaurant in the earlier hours with playful Sharon acting up to the cameras and pretending to grab Louis’ crotch.
The Irishman was in fits of giggles as the redhead, dressed in a smart black suit, placed one hand in front of his privates and another around his back while sporting a serious pout.

Earlier in the evening the panel had faced a tough decision whether to send Relley or the four-piece home.
X Factor's Relley C has become the third act voted off the live finals
After losing her place in the competition, Relley said: “From the start I said if can make it to the first live show I’d be happy.
“I could have done with a bit more time but I’m happy I got this far.”
Mentor Sharon added: “She’s a strong girl and she’s a fighter.”
Sharon gave a sultry stare to the waiting photographers
Rather than opening the lines at the end of each episode once all the acts have performed like usual, viewers could now vote for their favourite contestants before they’ve even taken to the stage.

 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton arrive on stage for the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri on October 9, 2016. 
BEAUMONT - The Beaumont Enterprise has joined a growing list of newspapers endorsing a Democrat for president for the first time in years.
The endorsement of Clinton headlined ""Hillary Clinton is the least objectionable choice for president"" was published on Sunday.
The Enterprise, which last endorsed a Democrat when they endorsed Bill Clinton in 1996, mentioned Clinton's ""imperfections"" citing her use of a private email server among other things.
The newspaper went on to say that ""above all Clinton must be judged against the other major-party candidate, Donald Trump. While she may be partially untrustworthy, he is completely unsuitable.""

Stephanie Skilbeck, 19, was cradling her baby boy when the intruder armed with the gardening tool jumped over the fence of her Western Australian home where he allegedly threatened to kill her.
Her boyfriend Lee Walker, 24, intervened after hearing her cries for help. He was struck with the shovel four times in the head after tackling the intruder in the backyard on Monday.
The woman handed her 10-month-old baby to a neighbour before she was able to get the intruder to let go of the shovel after biting his finger.

Police alleged when the woman initially screamed to her partner for help, the intruder threatened her, saying: 'I'll kill you if you don't shut up.'
She used the shovel to hit the man in a desperate effort for him to stop attacking Mr Walker. But after failing to stop him, she ran over to her neighbour's home for help.
Her boyfriend suffered minor injuries, including a bite wound on his hand and a deep gash to his head during the scuffle. He was treated in hospital for lacerations to his hands and head.
'He [boyfriend] saved us, who knows what would've happened if he hadn't been there,' Ms Skilbeck told 7 News.
Ms Skilbeck and her baby were not injured.
The neighbour and Mr Walker held the man until police arrived at the scene.

Earlier, the man allegedly punched a female doctor in the face in the car park after she arrived for work at Bunbury Hospital at about 7.20am on Monday before stealing her car
Neighbour Scott Gordon believed the suspect was under the influence of drugs.
'Most definitely on some significant drug that has given him 10 times amount of power,' Mr Gordon said.
'It took myself and two police officers, when they jumped the fence to put him in handcuffs.'
The 41-year-old man has since been arrested over the violent drug-fuelled rampage as he remains under police guard in hospital.

17582257,http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2016/10/23/michael-moore-any-trump-supporter-like-legal-terrorist.html,Michael Moore: Any Trump Supporter Like 'a Legal Terrorist',"Michael Moore saw Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” and he raised her a “legal terrorist.”
The controversy-seeking filmmaker used the phrase during a Rolling Stone interview published Friday to describe “any” supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Moore’s metaphor came on the heels of Democrat presidential nominee Clinton saying some Trump supporters fit in a “basket of deplorables,” a comment for which she later apologized.
“[Voters] can go in there and, even though you're not necessarily in favor of Trump and you don't like him that much and you know he's a little crazy, you also know he's going to blow up the system,” Moore said when asked about the turn of phrase. “The system that took your job and house away from you. You get to get back at the system now and blow it up and this is the only day you can do it legally.”
Though Moore was a prominent backer of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the Democrat primary, it didn’t take him long to switch allegiance to Clinton, the Democrat presidential nominee. Moore’s new film, “Michael Moore in Trumpland,” is less an excoriation of Trump than a love song for Clinton, as the director tells it.
“I wrote a chapter in my very first book 20 years ago called ‘My Forbidden Love for Hillary,’” Moore said. “There's nothing to come around on. I was for Hillary before Hillary was for Hillary.”
As if “legal terrorist” wasn’t a provocative-enough description, Moore also compared Trump to a child molester.
“You have to protect the population from him like you do with a pedophile,” Moore said. “A pedophile doesn’t need to be in prison; they’re sick. They have to be separated from us so they don’t hurt children. But you have to treat it that way.”

Shocking footage of the Saturday night attack outside one of the fast food chain’s restaurants was handed to The Sun.
Big attack . . . ‘racist’ customer was severely beaten by McDonald’s workers
Big whack . . . the manager joined in, taking it in turns to punch the man
It shows two uniformed restaurant workers and a manager taking it in turn to punch, kick and grab the client by the neck.
One grey-clad employee knocks the customer to the ground before a colleague rains hard punches and kicks down on him.
The man can then be heard shouting “You wanna go down that road?” as other diners who have rushed out of the restaurant to watch jeer abuse at him.
The incident happened at around 9.30pm on Saturday night in Bow, east London
A man wearing a white shirt and tie – understood to be a manager – also threw a punch when the middle-aged customer squares up to him.
The mobile phone footage was filmed at around 9.30pm on Saturday night in Bow, east London.
The person who filmed the video, who does not want to be named, told The Sun: “I was heading to McDonald’s for some food with friends when we saw a man shouting at staff inside.
“The customer was being very abusive and shouted ‘f****** Pakis’ at the workers, who were doing their best to calm him down.
“A couple of workers came from behind the counter and joined another one and started to push him out.
“The customer was pushing back but they managed to get him outside.
The man allegedly shouted at staff ‘f***ing pa*kis’
The employees ‘lost their cool’ and started battering the man
“I didn’t hear what was said inside but it was obvious that it was really kicking off in there.
“Other customers came out and were calling him a f****** racist.
“That’s when I started filming it – but I couldn’t believe it when they started punching him – it was mental.”
The source added: “ They lost their cool big time. I could’t believe what I was seeing – especially when the manager started getting involved. It was shocking how they went at him.”
A source close to the restaurant staff said the victim of the attack had provoked it with his behaviour: “The employees claim the customer was really drunk and making a proper nuisance of himself inside the restaurant.
“He was approaching other customers and causing a disturbance to begin with.
“Then, acccording to the manager involved, when staff asked him to leave he got worse and started to racially abuse them. I’m not sure what words he used but they must have been strong because everyone who heard him was incensed.
“I know he was yelling at them: ‘What are you doing in this country? Go back to your own country.’ Giving it all that. ”
Personal safety experts who viewed the footage said that even if they had been provoked the fast food workers should not have lost control.
Earl Walker, who runs self-defence firm Personal Safety Training, said: “Judging from the footage it would appear these workers have seriously let themselves down.
“If the customer was causing a disturbance or being racially abusive they should have called the police and waited for them to deal with him.
Footage was filmed by a fellow customer who was ‘shocked’ by assault
Big crack . . . the customer was knocked to the ground after being beaten
“The staff were definitely over the top in the way they reacted.
“Throwing punches and kicking someone when they are on the ground can’t be justified as self defence.”
A McDonald’s spokeswoman said: “*We take matters like this extremely seriously.*
“All employees involved were called into the restaurant and disciplinary action will take place as a matter of urgency.”
None of the staff at the restaurant would comment.
The Bow branch is close to the Isle of Dogs McDonalds where Leeds footballer Lee Bowyer was fined for affray for racially abusing Asian staff in 1996.

Be First to Share ->
Iman Shumpert, the Cleveland Cavaliers shooting guard, could be traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves before next year’s trade deadline, per multiple reports.
Tom Thibodeau, coach-cum-president of the Timberwolves, recently contacted the Cavaliers front office about the availability of Shumpert, according to ESPN insider Zach Lowe.
Shumpert, a defensive specialist, would be a perfect fit under Thibodeau, who is well renowned for his defensive schemes and principles.
In fact, Lowe reported that Timberwolves aren’t the only team to inquire about Shumpert.
Iman Shumpert to Minny?
Lowe didn’t reveal if the Cavaliers have made Shumpert available, seeing as the two-guard was an integral member of their championship-winning team.
Earlier this year, there were several reports over Cleveland’s interest in Timberwolves point guard Ricky Rubio.
Perhaps, the Cavaliers and Timberwolves could work on a trade that would send the Spaniard to Cleveland in exchange for Shumpert?
It could prove to be a win-win scenario for both teams.
In Kris Dunn, the Timberwolves have already found their point guard of the future. Also, sophomore Tyus Jones is a viable backup who impressed during the Las Vegas Summer League with a tally of 19.4 points, 6.3 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 1.3 steals.
Shumpert for Rubio?
Therefore, Minnesota seem to have enough depth at the 1 spot even if they decide to trade Rubio.
The Cavaliers, on the other hand, are desperate for a backup point guard. After losing Matthew Dellavedova to free agency, the Cavaliers were dealt with another blow after Mo Williams decided to call it quits.
The Cavs are entering the new season without a clear backup to Kyrie Irving.
Rubio has been linked with the defending NBA champions for a few months. This Hoops Habit writer opines that Rubio is the perfect compliment to Irving.
“Ricky Rubio would be the perfect complement to Irving and fit for the Cavaliers.
“With Zach LaVine and Kris Dunn as the future at point guard for the Minnesota Timberwolves, Rubio is likely an available asset. He’s mentioned in the past how he’s wanted out of Minnesota and to play in a bigger market.”
Will the Cavs succumb to pressure and deal Iman Shumpert? Stay tuned for latest NBA Rumors.

Leaving little to the imagination! One black and white image sees Hannah wearing nothing but a pair of sky-high heels
Inside the magazine, there are black and white images of Hannah posing topless.
In one particularly saucy image, the model is completely naked aside from the pair of sky-high stilettos she is wearing.
Another picture sees Hannah wearing pants, a leather biker hat, and suspenders that are strategically covering her bare breasts.

In most of the images Hannah's dark blonde hair is loose and flowing in her face, and while she looks right at home flaunting her trim figure, Maxim insists that the model seams to be 'more farm girl than man-eater'.
Earlier this week Hannah was out fishing and ended up with a very impressive catch, taking to Instagram to post a photo of herself holding a giant fish.
'I caught my FIRST Wahoo !!! 57lbs [sic],' she captioned the image, which sees her wearing a string bikini.

She also shared a photo of herself with the Mahi-mahi she caught for 'Mahi Monday'.
In a recent video for the Australian swimwear label Seafolly, Hannah said 'growing up on a farm was pretty awesome'.
'We had sheep, goats, chickens, turkeys, a couple of geese and a duck. Dogs and cats. I have a lot of appreciation for nature and animals,' she says.
'And now I live in the city, and I find that I miss that and I miss being around animals and being out in the country. I think it helps keep me grounded.'

eef182e1,http://www.vindy.com/news/2016/oct/24/obama-administration-confirms-double-digit-premium/,Vindy.com - Obama administration confirms double-digit premium hikes,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Premiums will go up sharply next year under President Barack Obama's health care law, and many consumers will be down to just one insurer, the administration confirmed today. That will stoke another ""Obamacare"" controversy days before a presidential election.
Before taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less.
Moreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles.
""Consumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open-enrollment period,"" said Larry Levitt, who tracks the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.
Republicans will pounce on the numbers as confirmation that insurance markets created by the 2010 health overhaul are on the verge of collapsing in a ""death spiral."" Sign-up season starts Nov. 1, about a week before national elections in which the GOP remains committed to a full repeal. Window shopping for plans and premiums is already available through HealthCare.gov.

Valantis Barkas says his family has worked with investigators for a quarter of a century to try to solve the mystery of 21-month-old Ben’s disappearance.

He said: ‘Kerry should be ashamed of herself. We are very upset by the things she has said about my father Dinos – such as that he should burn in hell.'

Pain without end: Ben's devastated mother Kerry, left above, grandmother Christine, centre, and grandfather Eddie, right, broke down in floods of tears as they visited the farmhouse where Ben was last seen 25 years ago
Speaking exclusively to MailOnline following the completion of South Yorkshire Police’s ‘Operation Ben’ Valantis Barkas said: ‘It’s been 25 years and they have found nothing at all – not a shred of evidence to support these wild allegations against my father.
‘My father has been accused of being a child killer and his picture has been published everywhere without a trace of evidence.
‘I have remained calm throughout all of this. We have nothing to hide. We have tried to help [the Operation Ben police investigation].
‘It is too easy to blame the dead. My father is dead and his name has been dragged through the mud. He was a beautiful man. He was well respected.
‘There was no better man than my father Dinos, God always wants good people with him.’
Kerry Needham condemned Dinos to ‘burn in hell’ after she was told the digger driver knew that Ben had died at the remote farmhouse in July 1991 but had never told anyone.

Investigation: Detective Inspector Jon Cousins of South Yorkshire Police yesterday said 'it is his belief' that Ben died in an accident as he concluded the search for his body on the Greek island of Kos
The heartbroken mother accused him of taking the truth about little Ben ‘to his grave’.
Konstantinos ‘Dinos’ Barkas died of cancer last year. Now Dinos’ son Valantis has accused Kerry Needham of shaming is memory.
He told MailOnline: ‘We have always respected Kerry Needham but we are very upset by the things she has said about my father Dinos – such as that he should burn in hell.
‘I would tell Kerry Needham please choose your words more carefully.
‘We have nothing against British people. Why is she trying to provoke us by saying that?
‘We have nothing to hide. It’s very upsetting for the whole family.
‘This whole affair has really upset my mother [widow Varvara Barkas] and our friends and neighbours.
‘I understand her despair but she should blame someone else not my father who is dead and cannot defend himself.
In a press conference this morning, DI Cousins said 93 items, mostly of 'low interest' had been discovered during recent searches on Kos - some of which were due tobe taken back to the UK for examination

‘How is my dad going to be remembered after all of this?
‘My daughter is called Konstantina, she is named after my father, she is six months old.
‘But Dinos’ grandchildren will grow up and read all of these bad things against him.'
Wife Ioanna added: ‘Kerry Needham should come and apologise to my husband about what she said about his father.
Dinos Barkas is accused of accidentally killing Ben Needham when he went under wheels of his JCB digger while playing outside the remote farmhouse in Kos which his grandfather Eddie was renovating.
Barkas is also accused of covering up the death and hiding the toddler’s body at a fly-tip where he disposed of his waste, South Yorkshire Police claim.
However his son Valantis has challenged this version of events, saying his father is innocent.
He told MailOnline: ‘For as long as dad was alive he helped the police. For 25 years they have found nothing.

The map above shows the area the police, along with volunteers, searched for three weeks in Kos
‘The police, the volunteers, even the army searched whole area in 1991 and they did not find anything.
‘These allegations against my father have come out of thin air.
‘When you are driving a digger you are high up, the cabin has glass all around, you have very good visibility, unlike an articulated lorry, you can even see a mouse on the ground below you.
‘He has been accused of shaking and being nervous but that is not true. When my father left the prosecutor’s office he was a cool as a cucumber. He does not look like a guilty man [in the picture that has been published of him].
‘It was a long time ago. I was six years old when Ben Needham went missing.’
He added: ‘I have met [British police lead investigator detective inspector] Jon Cousins. He is welcome to search the whole island [of Kos]. I have answered every question that he asked of me.’
The Ben Needham case had worsened Greece’s problems, the family claimed.
Family friend Elias Nobiles said: ‘Kos has had really bad business because of the migrants and now because of Ben Needham, we really can’t afford that. Everyone is talking about Kos in a bad way.
‘For God’s sake let Dinos rest in peace.’
Valantis Barkas, 31, runs a café on the outskirts of Kos Town.
Ms Needham, left with her parents Christine and Eddie, broke down in tears when they visited the farmhouse which Ben disappeared from 25 years ago
He is understood to be Dinos Barkas’ only son. He supports his elderly and widowed mother Varvara
Last night regulars at the Deluxe Café condemned Kerry Needham for ‘ruining’ Dinos’ reputation.
One said angrily: ‘How can this woman say these bad things about Dinos.
‘He was such a good man. He would help anyone. But now she has ruined his reputation!’
South Yorkshire Police yesterday announced that 21-month-old Ben Needham had been killed – by accident – by Dinos Barkas in July 1991 when he ran the toddler over with digger by the remote farm house – even though the boy’s body has never been found.
DI Jon Cousins said it was his ‘professional opinion’ that Barkas then dumped the little body at a fly-tip where his team recovered Ben’s toy car on Saturday.
DI Cousins said: ‘It is my professional belief that Ben Needham died as a result of an accident near to the farmhouse in Iraklis where he was last seen playing.
‘Based on the information that I have now, as a result of an extensive and thorough investigation, it is without doubt that the current line of enquiry is the most probable cause for Ben’s disappearance.
‘My team and I know that machinery, including a large digger, was used to clear an area of land on 24 July 1991, behind the farmhouse that was being renovated by the Needham’s.
‘The events leading up to and following that incident have been explored by my team of experts to great lengths. The fact that we have not had a direct result during this visit to Kos does not preclude the facts that we know to be true.’
In May this year a witness came forward claiming that Ben had been killed, in an accident, and his body buried by the guilt-ridden killer who feared he would be unfairly punished for the tragedy.
The witness said that Ben was crushed under the wheels of a large JCB digger that was clearly land around the farmhouse which his grandfather Eddie had been renovating.
The driver – Konstantinos ‘Dinos’ Barkas – had not noticed the little blonde boy go under the wheels of his powerful machine through the clouds of dust that swirled around, he claimed.
And when he saw what he had done he could not bring himself to admit his part the boy’s death so buried him amid the hundreds of tonnes of earth that he was excavating.
Barkas was interviewed by police in the hours after Ben was reported missing in July 1991 and released.
But he was later seen in a distressed state ‘sweating and shaking’ when he returned from the police station, the witness claimed.

After 19 years of marriage, Scottie and Larsa Pippen decided to part ways. According to reports, Scottie has been traveling a lot for business, prompting Larsa to call it quits. However, there seems to be a new wrinkle in the reason for their separation: Could rumored Larsa Pippen nude photos with rapper Future be true?
Over and over again, unfortunately, Hollywood affairs commonly end what’s supposed to be happy relationships due to infidelities. Although a few big names manage to end their marriages secretly, other cheating scandals get publicized and blown up. Before the NBA all-time great cover this up, here are five things about Scottie Pippen’s wife:
1. Larsa Pippen nude – Is she having an affair with Future?
Rumors are whirling that Future may have brought on Mr. and Mrs. Pippen’s divorce after Future was seen with Larsa in Miami days before the couple filed for separation.
Sources extremely close to Larsa affirmed that this was totally untrue. She and Future have been friends for quite a while, yet they have never been romantically attached to each other. Larsa likewise denied allegations of leaked naked photographs demanding respect for her four youngsters. Future’s camp has said a similar thing, stressing that he has no reasons to date a wedded lady.
2. Though consensual, Scottie filed the divorce
The 51-year-old former Chicago Bulls small forward filed the divorce case against Larsa on Tuesday in Florida.
They have been together since 1997 and were blessed with four children namely: Sophia, Justin, Preston, and Scottie Jr. Meanwhile, the basketball legend also has three children from previous relationships.
3. Larsa Pippen Nude – Kim K’s best friend
With Larsa Pippen’s scandal of her own, the 5-foot-2 beauty is definitely Keeping Up With The Kardashians.
Kim K actually considers Larsa as one of her best friends, saying Larsa gives great advice and makes her laugh like no one else can. Their kids often hang out a lot too. “She’s the kind of best friend you can tell anything to and will always have your back,” Kim affirmed.
4. (Former) Mrs. Pippen is a philanthropist
Purportedly, Larsa is very involved with the Pippen Foundation, which raises funds for different children’s charities. She is also on the committee for An Evening with the Chicago Bulls, an annual charity gala.
In case you’re wondering, according to google, a philanthropist is a person who seeks to promote the welfare of others, especially by the generous donation of money to good causes.
5. She’s a lifestyle blogger
If you want to know more about Larsa or how to live a fabulous Hollywood-like life yourself, we suggest you visit her personal website and read on her tips for cooking, decorating, beauty, fashion, and parenting. Moreover, she also writes for Haute Living and earned her own column called Life with Larsa on the “style, society, and celebrity” filled section of the Chicago Sun-Times – Splash.

One such product: a marijuana-laced oil that essentially allows you to absorb the drug vaginally and de-stress, in theory enhancing libido and leading to a better orgasm. However, Jennifer Gunter, M.D., director of pelvic pain and vulvovaginal disorder for Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco, says that this hasn't been proven. ""Any effect of this medication when given vaginally is happening because it's affecting your nervous system, and it's unlikely due to a local effect,"" she says. Plus, inserting products into the vagina that haven't been studied for their potential side effects is dangerous. ""Absorption can be erratic and the dosing in these products isn't tested for consistency or purity, so you could be getting a different amount every time you use it,"" says Gunter.
The same company that produced the sensual enhancement oil also released a cannabis vaginal suppository, which is inserted like a tampon and intended to ease PMS symptoms and menstrual cramps. Alyssa Dweck, M.D., assistant clinical professor of ob-gyn at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, says the thought behind the product might make sense—marijuana can act as a muscle relaxant—and since many cramps happen because of uterine muscle contractions, you'd think a product like this would help. But it hasn't been thoroughly studied either, and Gunter has doubts about the high levels of THC—the psychoactive component of marijuana that could be absorbed vaginally, she explains—that are recommended in order to actually give you some relief (960 mg). ""It's actually very high, so it seems to really only be designed for one purpose—to get you high."" And while there isn't currently much information about how inserting marijuana could affect the vagina's ecosystem, one study has linked cannabis to more vaginal yeast colonization. So unless you're willing to risk a bout of not-so-fun yeast infections, just say no until there's more research on whether either product is actually effective—and safe.

 Donald Trump lashed out at the media on Monday for not reporting that he is ""winning"" the 2016 race for the White House, just one day after the Republican nominee's campaign manager conceded he is ""behind"" Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. 
 ""We are winning and the press is refusing to report it,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning. ""Don't let them fool you - get out and vote!"" 
 Kellyanne Conway, the Trump campaign manager, acknowledged Sunday on ""Meet the Press"" that Clinton was in the lead with just over two weeks to go until Election Day. 
 ""We are behind,"" Conway said. ""She has some advantages."" 
 Trump has criticized the press throughout his campaign, but has intensified his attacks in recent weeks. 
 Polls show his campaign down nationally and in key battleground states. The Republican nominee trails Clinton by 5.8 points in the RealClearPolitics average of recent national polls, and Business Insider's latest Electoral College projection gives Clinton a 322-to-187 advantage, well over the threshold of 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.

Alien hunters claim the petite extraterrestrial is trying to defend “homes” from being crushed by the Curiosity rover.
UFO expert Scott C Waring suggested the puny human-like beast was sabotaging the US space agency’s probe on his UFO Daily Sightings blog.
SPOTTED: Alien hunters claim to have spotted a tiny alien on Mars
He said: “YouTube users Mars Alive has found a tiny alien figure inside the front left wheel of the rover.
“That’s right, and it looks 100% legit. It’s there and it’s about 3cm tall.
“That matches the other half dozen figures to found on Mars. The figure is standing upright and on a slanted edge, so its feet are slanted with it, much how a human stands.
“For it to get into the wheel it had to have crawled there, so it is alive, but it may be attempting to sabotage the rover in order to stop it from driving over homes.
“After this, I would not be surprised if the rover stopped working altogether.”
MYSTERY: The pint-sized creature was apparently 'sabotaging' the rover
 “That’s right, and it looks 100% legit. It’s there and it’s about 3cm tall.” 
 Scott C Waring 
NASA footage of the miniature monster was also posted to YouTube by Mars Alive.
The YouTube channel claim NASA have tried to “cover-up” the tiny alien by making the image darker.
It said: “Nasa have many tactics for covering up anomalies on Mars, for example in this image, they have made it darker.
“When they do this it’s because they are trying to hide something.”
Can you spot these extraterrestrial objects?
NASA has staunchly denied it has tried to cover up the existence of aliens.
There are many strange sightings in NASA images, which scientists claim is due to pareidolia – when the eyes trick the brain into seeing something that’s not there.
In another photo, alien hunters claimed to have found evidence of an ancient city on Mars.
A carved human face was visible in another – sparking claims an ancient civilisation lived on Mars.

BOULDER COUNTY, Colo. -- The suspect accused of shooting a pit bull close range in the head will be serving two years of community service, a spokesperson for the 20th Judicial District said Friday. 
Russell William Middleton, 38, was arrested in July 21, 2015, on three felony charges and one misdemeanor charge in connection with the case, according to the Boulder County Sheriff's Office.
Boulder County Animal Control found the dog, now called Beefcakes, on July 7. The dog was wandering in an empty parking lot and was seemingly in bad shape. 
Vets said the dog had been shot at close range and that the bullet fractured the dog's jaw bone in multiple locations. Beefcakes went through multiple surgeries last year to repair the damage.
Beefcakes was finally adopted by his new owners in April of this year.

(AP) — A fast-weakening Hurricane Matthew continued its march along the Atlantic coast Saturday, lashing two of the South's most historic cities and some of its most popular resort islands, flattening trees, swamping streets and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands.

The storm was blamed for at least four deaths in the U.S., all in Florida. In its long wake, it also left at least 470 dead in Haiti in one hard-hit district alone, according to officials, with other stricken areas still unreachable four days after the disaster struck.

Matthew raked Georgia and South Carolina with torrential rain and stiff winds, and — for the first time in its run up the U.S. coastline — its storm center blew ashore, making landfall north of Charleston, near the town of McClellanville, where it caused serious flooding.

Up until then, the center, or eye, mercifully stayed just far enough out at sea that coastal communities didn't feel the full force of Matthew's winds. As the storm passed one city after another, the reaction was relief that things were nowhere near as bad as many feared.

""We are all blessed that Matthew stayed off our coast,"" Florida Gov. Rick Scott said. ""We are blessed that we didn't have a direct hit.""

As of 11 a.m., Matthew was just barely a hurricane, with winds of 75 mph. That was down from 145 mph when the storm roared into Haiti. It was moving at 12 mph.

Among the cities bracing for its effects later in the day were Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina. From there, the storm was expected to veer out to sea and loop back around toward the Bahamas, though as a much-weakened storm.

North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory warned people not to let their guard down just because Matthew was losing steam.

In Savannah, Georgia, a historic town of moss-draped squares and antebellum mansions, floodwaters several feet deep submerged a long stretch of President Street, which links downtown to the highway to Georgia's Tybee Island. A woman was seen staggering through waters up to her neck.

The shivering woman made it to the water's edge. A bystander handed her a sheet, which she wrapped around her neck.

""I'm homeless,"" said the woman, who identified herself only as Valerie. ""I've got nine kids, but I couldn't evacuate with them.""

Matthew also brought some of the highest tides on record along the South Carolina coast. Streets in Charleston — a city of handsome pre-Civil War homes, church steeples and romantic carriage rides — were flooded.

Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said water shut down about 100 roads and streets in the city, with serious flooding near the Medical University of South Carolina.

Leigh Webber watched the torrential rains from the porch of her home in the city's historic district.

""It's not as bad as maybe I was expecting,"" she said.

""I feel badly for a lot of the businesses downtown that have been closed since Wednesday,"" she added. ""I noticed a lot of hotels were completely closed. I know some weddings were canceled and it was a huge financial loss for a lot of people.""

South Carolina's golf-and-tennis resort Hilton Head Island also took a blow as the eye of the storm passed 20 miles to the east. At least one gust of 87 mph was recorded at Hilton Head.

The two roads onto the island of 40,000 people were blocked by fallen pine trees, and many roads were under water. Signs were blown over, and power was out across the island.

Chandler Brunson and was among those trying to go back to her home after evacuating, but found her path blocked.

""I think we're going to have a pine tree splitting our house,"" she said. ""That's what I'm afraid of.""

Residents of Brunswick, Georgia, woke to roads covered by water or fallen trees and power lines. All access points to nearby St. Simons Island from the mainland were blocked. Tybee Island also took a beating, with gusts clocked at 93 mph.

Nearly a half-million electric customers in South Carolina were left without power, and 250,000 were in the dark in coastal Georgia.

Matthew — the most powerful hurricane to threaten the Atlantic Seaboard in more than a decade — set off alarms as it closed in on the U.S., triggering evacuation orders covering at least 2 million people.

But in the end, the hurricane skirted Florida's heavily populated Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach area and sideswiped cities farther north, including Daytona Beach, Vero Beach, Cape Canaveral and Jacksonville, without its center ever actually coming ashore in Florida.

The damage consisted largely of fallen trees and power lines, eroded beaches and flooded roads. In northeastern Florida, the storm gouged out several large sections of the coastal A1A highway north of Daytona Beach.

Well south of the storm, things quickly began returning to normal Saturday, with all three of Orlando's main theme parks — Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld — reopening in the morning.

The deaths in Florida included an elderly St. Lucie County couple who died from carbon monoxide fumes while running a generator in their garage and two women who were killed when trees fell on a home and a camper.

On Friday, the storm raked yet another historic Southern city: St. Augustine, Florida, which was founded by the Spanish in the 1500s and includes a 17th-century stone fortress and many historic homes turned into bed-and-breakfasts. The city was left awash in rain and gray seawater, though the floodwaters had mostly receded by morning.

On Saturday, property manager Nick Trunck was in the city's historic district to check on several stores and apartments. He said he was prepared for the worst, but the damage consisted of little more than several lost shingles, a lost awning and water seeping into one area.

Trunck had arranged for 10 men to come from Connecticut to help with the cleanup, but after getting a look at the aftermath, he said he didn't think he needed anything but ""a couple of guys and a mop.""

aebec39b,http://www.yourtango.com/2016296458/dogging-british-sex-craze-youve-never-heard,Dogging: The British Sex Craze You've Probably NEVER Heard Of,"Are you into dogging?
It has NOTHING to do with walking your dog.
The word dogging sounds innocent enough. If you heard it, you might think someone was talking about taking a number of dogs on a walk, or maybe participating in an Alaskan dog race. But dogging is actually the practice of having sex with someone in a public place while others watch on.
Dogging has been a thing in England for a while now, and has expanded to people (often more than two) having sex in a parked car in a car park (British for parking lot), or other spots after having spread the word about where they'd (people having sex) be via the internet.
Many times, the spectators masturbate while watching. There are even places that have become known as being the best place to go if you're in the mood for dogging. We have something similar in the States called parks, where you can go and watch public sex if you're so inclined.
Dogging combines voyeurism, exhibitionism, group sex, mutual masturbation, and the power of the internet, making it a popular way to get off in England. 
Pinterest
It seems strange that the more sexually experimental Americans haven't embraced dogging the way that the Brits have. Maybe it's our Puritanical roots, or maybe we like to watch porn from the safety of our own homes.
In Britain, dogging falls through the legal loophole as it's not an offense... unless it's witnessed by someone who is outraged by the goings on.
I have to wonder: isn't half the fun of public sex not knowing if you're going to get caught? I mean, car sex is uncomfortable and you don't normally choose to bone in a car unless there are reasons (for example, you're a teen, or your roommate is home). I'm also wondering what having copious amounts of semen sprayed on your car does to your paint job.
Since dogging is trendy in the UK, they have all kinds of things devoted to it — websites that list dogging hot spots, forums for people almost caught by the police, dogging porn, and even a feature film that was originally called Dogging: A Love Story, but now can be found under the title, Public Sex.
The IMDB description of Public Sex reads, ""An aspiring journalist drops his inhibitions to research the UK's outdoor sex scene. He meets a certain girl in a car park and the totally unexpected happens."" That's one thing that they didn't cover in Downton Abbey: The UK's outdoor sex scene.
However, like Downton Abbey, there are a number of etiquette rules that one must follow when dogging: if your car light is off, you are indicating that you want to be left alone; if your light is on, you definitely want people to watch. 
Favim
The theory is that the term came from men who were walking their dogs and came upon people having sex. It's strange, though, how dogging can be such a phenomenon in the United Kingdom and virtually unknown here.
So if someone invites you to go dogging with them, make sure you're on the same page as they are, especially if exhibition and/or group car sex isn't your thing.

5c3409b9,http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/18/opinions/melania-trump-interview-drexler/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_latest+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Most+Recent%29,Is Melania Trump dropping a clue?,"Melania Trump on 2005 tape: It was like 2 teenage boys
 (CNN)Last night, in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Melania Trump came out in staunch defense of her husband, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, telling Cooper that the women who had accused Trump of groping them were lying, and that he'd been ""egged on"" by ex-""Access Hollywood"" host Billy Bush ""to say dirty and bad stuff."" 
For those who somehow missed what this is all about, a recording made in 2005 while Donald Trump and Bush were on the show's bus revealed Trump boasting that he kissed unwitting women and felt free to ""grab 'em by the pussy,"" and unsurprisingly, a maelstrom of denunciations ensued. At the second presidential debate a few days later, Trump of course denied there was any truth in the comments, reiterating that the banter was merely ""locker room talk,"" and that he had never done what he'd bragged about. 
But then a number of women made new allegations, suggesting that, perhaps, he had indeed done those things. 
Melania Trump entire CNN interview (Part 1)
Some may wonder if Melania Trump is in denial about all this (consider: In the last week alone, seven women have come forward with claims her husband touched them inappropriately), or if perhaps she is only doing what's expected of her. At this point in any presidential race, but perhaps this one in particular, it's not unusual for the candidates and their team — and their spouses -- to stay the course. 
But it's interesting that while Melania Trump has been supportive of her husband — and, indeed, insisted to Cooper that her husband is ""...kind. He's a gentleman ... supports everybody ... supports women"" — and has echoed his claims that the election coverage is biased and the election itself rigged, she has remained notably removed from the campaign. 
Melania Trump threatens to sue news outlets
After the tape surfaced, she issued a written statement condemning the comments. Hollywood Life and others wondered if the cheek kiss she allowed her husband after the second debate was as icy as it looked on screen.
And even as Trump's children and advisers encouraged her to participate in a sit-down interview with her husband to address the recent claims, according to The New York Times, she declined. 
She's never liked the spotlight, sure. She was burned after parts of her speech at the Republican National Convention were revealed to have been cribbed from Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic National Convention speech. As Vanity Fair put it, she's ""never quite warmed up to the role of campaign spouse."" Though she is smart, well-spoken, and certainly camera friendly, she has described herself, when it comes to her husband's campaign, as ""a mom first."" 
Or maybe there's more to it. 
Where is Melania Trump?
Monday night, although Melania spoke to Cooper on behalf of her husband, it's notable that she did so a mere 48 hours before the final debate — and on her own, without him by her side. Her remarks, too, seemed to make the point that she was standing up just as much for herself; as she told Cooper, she doesn't want anyone's pity. ""I'm very strong,"" she said. ""And people — they don't really know me. People think and talk about me like, 'Oh, Melania, oh poor Melania.' Don't feel sorry for me. ... I can handle everything.""
It's not hard to imagine this as a subtle distancing from her husband, a reinforcement of her own power as a woman more than a wife. And should Trump lose the race, it wouldn't be surprising if Melania distances herself even more. 
Though Trump has campaigned largely on his business prowess and power, on Monday night, Melania described him as, well, quite immature. ""Sometimes I say I have two boys at home. I have my young son and I have my husband,"" she told Cooper.
Is that what she wants from her husband? Perhaps. Or perhaps it's a preview: Maybe it's not only Republicans seeking to separate their fates from those of Donald Trump.

Polling places opened Monday in 50 counties in Florida, including the state’s largest counties — Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Orange and Palm Beach. In Colorado, early voting centers opened Monday morning in all 64 counties across the state.
Also Monday, polling places began opening in Alaska, Arkansas, Massachusetts and Texas.
Vote by mail
Early voting by mail has been underway for weeks in many states. However, in-person early voting recently began in some states, allowing people to travel to voting centers to cast their ballots, in much the same way as voting on Election Day. So far, more than 5 million ballots have been cast.
Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia offer some in-person early voting, while many others allow absentee mail-in voting without having to provide an excuse for not being able to come to the polls.
Three states, Oregon, Washington and now Colorado, have enacted a vote-by-mail system in which all registered voters receive their ballots in the mail several weeks before Election Day. Voters can then mail their ballots back or drop them off at designated collection points through Election Day.
A voter casts her ballot during early voting in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., Oct. 14, 2016.
Recent data from the Pew Research Center indicates that early voting totals this election may well swell beyond 50 million, the most ever. That would be a significant proportion of the overall voter turnout, which is estimated at 130 million ballots.
More voters opt to vote early
In 1996, about 10 percent of voters used an alternative voting methods, either voting early or casting absentee ballots, according to U.S. Census data. Four years ago, in the last presidential election, that figure had tripled, to nearly 33 percent.
And in some individual states, that number is much higher. More than half of the ballots cast in the 2012 election in Nevada, Arizona, Texas, North Carolina, Montana, New Mexico and Tennessee were either early or absentee, according to Pew researchers.
Unlike most democracies, the U.S. does not have a centrally administered electoral system, meaning each state — and in some cases, even each county — determines how and when residents can vote.
Absentee voting began more than a century ago during the American Civil War, as a way for soldiers in combat to send their ballots back home. By the mid-20th century, most states had adopted some form of absentee voting, although it was restricted, usually requiring specific evidence that a voter was unable to cast a ballot in person on Election Day.
California, Oregon and Washington were among the first states in the 1970s and 1980s to allow voters to choose to cast absentee ballots without providing a specific reason. Today, 27 states and the District of Columbia allow “no excuse” absentee voting for their residents.
Regardless of how or where they vote, more and more Americans are acting early on their electoral choices. This has begun to alter political parties’ traditional campaign exhortations for everyone to get out and vote on Election Day.
Apart from the convenience early voting offers to most people, the trend can either help or hurt candidates whose campaigns peak just before Election Day. Campaign rhetoric during the last weeks before voting day this year will have relatively little or no effect on large numbers of voters.

All campaign long, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly has served as one of the country’s chief media critics. When Donald Trump has weathered controversies for his remarks about minorities and women, O’Reilly has been there to assess the messengers. “Americans are tired, sick and tired of far-left media people accusing others of racism, bigotry, and hatred,” said the host on his program last month.
And now O’Reilly may have landed perhaps his biggest media scoop ever. Bigger than Brian Williams embellishing; bigger than his former boss’s sexual harassment scandal; bigger than the Rolling Stone rape story; bigger than Tronc-Gannett; bigger than O’Reilly’s own embellishments about his reportorial career. It’s so big that the Erik Wemple Blog fears that abridging it would do it an injustice. So let’s just leave O’Reilly’s own words as the authority on this matter. In an interview this morning with Fox News host Bill Hemmer, O’Reilly, ever the investigative reporter, said this in the context of the country’s reaction to last night’s second presidential debate:
It’s a complicated situation, but I think everyone can agree — except for the media organizations that now have ordered their employees to destroy Trump — there’s at least three of them. And, I can’t say who they are right now because I don’t have it nailed down, but I am 100 percent convinced, and these media organizations have actually put out, ‘If you support Trump, your career is done done here.’ … News organizations have sent, not officially, but through the corporate grapevine that we don’t want anybody supporting Trump. If you study it, you can see which ones they are.
Now this is the toughest form of reporting out there: There are no documents, no emails and no memos, apparently. Just “grapevine” communications, as O’Reilly terms them. Hats off to this cable news talent. In between promoting his new book, “Killing the Rising Sun: How America Vanquished World War II Japan,” hosting his industry-leading primetime show and doing all the other things that the King of Cable News must do, O’Reilly has managed to gather the necessary human intelligence — that is, real-live sources high on the command chain at major U.S. media conglomerates — to aver on live television that perhaps the most sprawling media conspiracy in U.S. history is afoot.
This sort of reporting is why Bill O’Reilly is the King of Cable News. We’ve asked Fox News when O’Reilly will disclose the results of his investigation, because we can’t afford to miss it.

Besides being a fitness and bikini model, the M&F June Iron Maiden says she's really a tomboy at heart. It was probably because of all that skateboarding she did growing up. Here's what else she had to say.
M&F: Would you say you’re a girlie girl or can you get your hands dirty sometimes?
Ana Cheri: I’d like to say I’m more of a girlie girl these days, but growing up with four brothers, playing football and basketball was a given. When I go home, the rowdiness definitely comes out!
M&F: What’s your favorite workout; how do you keep in shape these days?
AC: I’m a huge fan of “leg day” and I’m always doing lower body. I can’t get enough of it. And I also deadlift. My max was 205 lbs. and I’m like 125 lbs. I was really proud of myself on that one!
M&F: Any crazy stories from modeling shoots?
AC: I was once doing a pretty risqué bikini shoot on the beach in Malibu and this school field trip came around the corner out of nowhere. I scrambled to find a towel. At first I was so embarrassed and then we just laughed about the whole thing, the timing was awful, but the look on the parents’ faces was priceless!
M&F: As you said, you grew up in house full of boys. So playing with action figures seems like a no brainer?
AC: I love superheroes, it’s crazy! My favorites are Thor and Batman. I’m also a big fan of the television series Gotham.
M&F: When you’re working out what could a guy do to get your attention?
AC: Not wear cologne! I hate it when guys wear cologne to the gym. When I’m working out heavy and inhaling a lot, I don’t want to breathe in your aftershave. Just take a shower!
M&F: So besides not wearing cologne to the gym, what else do you find attractive in a guy?
AC: When I see that a guy is being genuinely kind to other people and not just to impress me. That’s the most attractive thing to me, that gets me every time.

He Allegedly Slept With Kylie,"  Rumors 
Kylie Jenner posted a picture herself, Scott Disick and Kendall Jenner sitting on the car. Although there seems to be nothing wrong with the photo, one would wonder why the two sisters seem so enamored by Scott Disick, Kourtney Kardashian’s ex-husband and the father of their three kids.
A photo posted by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Oct 22, 2016 at 5:29pm PDT
The rumors surrounding the relationship between the Jenner sisters and Scott isn’t new. The Hollywood Life had quotedLife & Style magazine as saying that Kylie doesn’t seem to think there is anything wrong with flirting with Scott. “[Kylie] doesn’t see the problem in flirting, or doing more, with the father of her niece and nephews,” a source tells Life & Style.
This is not where it ends. Scott Disick seems to have boasted among his friends that he has even slept with Kylie Jenner. “There are no boundaries there.”
The source has gone on to say that he has very good chemistry with Kendall as well. “Her chemistry with Scott is off the charts,” says the source.
However, the source has also said that Kendall definitely doesn’t want to upset the big sister. “Kendall doesn’t want to upset Kourtney, but if they weren’t sisters, she would have hooked up with him by now.”
The sources have stated that what he feels for Kylie is real. “His feelings for Kylie and Kendall are real,” the mag’s insider claims.
Scott is actually involved with both the sisters. “He’s carrying on with both of them. It is completely wrong. Scott’s known for making a mess of things, but this takes the cake. It’s one twisted love triangle.”
The wild claims go as far as saying that he tried to date women who look like Kendall and Kylie. “Scott tried to date Kendall and Kylie look-alikes for a long time,” the source admits. “Recently he realized, why do that when he can maybe have the real thing?”

Questions were also raised when Kylie Jenner posted a picture of herself in a skimpy bikini with Scott. The two definitely looked like they were having a lot of fun. Do you think there is a chemistry between Kylie Jenner and Scott Disick?
Us Weekly had reported that Kylie Jenner had chosen to spend time with Scott Disick after she broke up with Tyga in May this year.
The sources go on to say that Kylie can truly relax with Scott Disick “Kylie was not wearing a lot of makeup,” a source said, Us Weekly has reported. “She was in a cream sweater and black pants, [and] seemed like she was in a good mood. [She] was drinking Pellegrino.” Do you think Kylie Jenner was hooking up with Scott Disick?
Another Hollywood Life report has gone on to say that Scott Disick got closer to Kendall Jenner during Kim Kardashian’s wedding in 2014.
“Scott timed it perfectly,” the mag says. The publication says he made the move when no one was noticing. “Everyone was so caught up in Kim’s wedding that they didn’t pick up on anything else that was going on around them, and Scott jumped at the opportunity to get cozy with Kendall.”
Scott made his move when he was with Kendall in Europe. “He did it because he enjoyed it and he convinced Kendall that there was nothing wrong with them misbehaving a little.”
The Inquistr had also reported that Kendall and Scott were probably having an affair once again amidst the possibility that she was pregnant with Scott Disick’s baby.

Criminal Minds cast member Thomas Gibson was thrown off the show after a physical confrontation with one of the show’s producers, forcing the writers to make a “special” exit scene for his character, Special Agent Aaron Hotchner.
However, due to the foreseen drop in its ratings, the American drama series decided to bring him back…for a while.
Criminal Minds Cast – Why is Thomas Gibson still on the show?
For a lot of Criminal Minds avid enthusiasts, losing Aaron Hotchner on the show is like eating spaghetti without cheese.
Fans were upset over losing Gibson’s character to the point that many of them took their rage to Twitter venting out their disappointments over his departure. Hashtags such as #SupportThomas Gibson and #NoHotchNoWatch were trending since the release of the sad news. With this huge bolster drawn by Gibson and his character, forecasts show that the season’s appraisals are bound to drop significantly in the following scenes if Gibson’s “non-appearance” continues.
Why is Thomas Gibson still on the show?Well, it’s due to (great) public demand.
Gibson’s cause of termination
While it’s true that Hotchner may be back soon, the sad news is it will not last long. According to reports, Hotchner will be the prey of the series’ latest serial killer. Why?
Because the management has indicated his permanent departure, making use of season 12’s episode four as the chance for fans to bid their final goodbyes.
Last July, Gibson has encountered a conflict with co-executive producer/writer Virgil Williams while filming the second episode of season 12. Rumors say that the argument started when he aggressively questioned a line in the dialogue. For his part, Gibson stated that Williams suddenly entered the room and started charging at him, while he was talking to his fellow Criminal Minds cast members. Gibson narrated that he hit William on the leg, a move only to prevent Williams from running into him.
Nonetheless, no matter how hard you protest, the decision is final. As a matter of fact, Erica Messer is already plotting the “special” exit of Gibson, which may happen this November.
Will Thomas Gibson return next season? Photo courtesy of flickr.com.

The state of affairs between the US and Russia at this time seems to be unstable. A US Russia War has become a greater concern more recently; shades of the Cold War and nuclear arms races are being reflected in today’s reality. Given the current situation, has the US elevated its defense system to DEFCON level 3?
DEFCON refers to “defense readiness condition”, the state’s level of readiness to act against an external threat such as that of nuclear war. DEFCON can be referred to in its 5 levels. Level 5 would be the state of lowest risk. Level 1, on the other hand, would refer to an imminent threat of nuclear war and indicate the state’s position to immediately respond. Level 3 means that the US Air Force will be ready to mobilise in a mere 15 minutes.
According to the unofficial site DEFCON Warning System, DEFCON is already at level 3. Current international events, rising tensions, and therefore the increased possibility of a declared US Russia War seems to have raised the level. There is no lack of potential triggers – the greatest of which would be the state of the Syrian civil war, which has had both the US and Russia blaming each other over a broken ceasefire agreement, bombed aid envoys, and devastating airstrikes on and around Aleppo. With the US backing rebel groups and Russia pushing Bashar al-Assad’s government, the continued bloodshed has not made communication between the two nations any easier.

Meanwhile, Russia has joined China in trying to block the operation of a US missile network in Europe and Asia. The tensions have even spilled over onto the presidential elections, where suspicions of Donald Trump conspiring with Russians have cropped up.
Though the threat of war seems to be rising on a few fronts, the DEFCON level 3 indication reported by the website is only speculation; the actual DEFCON status is not shared with the public by the US Military for obvious security reasons. The website, unaffiliated with any branch of the military, urges visitors to “make their own evaluations” and “learn what steps to take in the event of a nuclear attack”.
While being ready for a nuclear attack or a US Russia War would certainly put the public at ease, however, nothing would do that better than the two superpowers simply backing down.

Xi said the military retreat undertaken by the Red Army of the Chinese Communist Party in the 1930s represents the ""glory of the people's army,"" state-owned Xinhua news agency reported.
The Chinese leader also called for a new generation of Chinese soldiers who serve with ""soul, high caliber, gut and virtue,"" and the creation of troops with ""iron-like belief, conviction, discipline and commitment.""
""The Long March is the glory of the people's army, and the honorable people's army must always carry forward the great spirit and fine tradition of the Red Army in the Long March,"" Xi said.
Xi also framed the Long March in the context of China's anti-imperial struggle against Japan, and stated the event ""awakened the [Chinese] people"" while forming a united front against the Japanese empire, although the retreat was in response to a Chinese Nationalist Party pursuit led by Chiang Kai-shek.
David Tsui, a historian of the Communist Party, told The South China Morning Post Xi's embrace of Chinese communist history is ""an effort to consolidate his power and promote his position as an orthodox successor to inherit the party's course.""
Xi's father, Xi Zhongxun, was a member of the first generation of Chinese communist leaders led by Mao Zedong.
The meeting of China's top officials is expected to include plans for the 19th party congress in 2017.
Five of the seven members of China's Politburo Standing Committee are expected to step down, with the exception of Xi and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang.

Katherine Stone is a 20-year-old who loves her family. She loves her family so much that she is selling her virginity for them. While that may sound counterintuitive, Katherine’s virginity auction has her family’s best intentions. 
In 2014, Stone’s family home in Seattle, Washington, was destroyed by a fire. They didn’t have home insurance and didn’t have the money to fix the damaged house. The family was forced to live inside the scorched house ever since. Now, Katherine is doing what she can to repair the house, and for her that means selling her virginity. 
“I found out all about the brothels and the money,” Stone said after seeing an ad on Facebook. “It made me think, ‘Wow, it’s a chance at fixing all that I need to fix.’”
A fire destroyed Katherine’s family home. So she found a controversial, but legal, way to help. Hear her story Sun on #ThisIsLife at 10p ET. pic.twitter.com/uodkuXC3Z2
— CNN Entertainment (@CNNent) October 21, 2016
However, the only place where prostitution is legal is Nevada where there are 19 brothels operating in the state.
She then moved to a legal bordello which is owned by brothel tycoon Dennis Hof.
Hof, who says he receives two to three similar requests a week, agreed to arrange the transaction on his “America’s Next Top Bunny Ranch Virgin!” showcase. He even waived his usual 50% cut.
“Katherine has the one thing that every man in the world wants—and that’s her virginity, and it’s that priceless female commodity that this brave and selfless girl is putting up on the auction block to rescue her family from ruin and destitution. Whether she wins the ‘America’s Next Top Bunny Ranch Virgin!’ contest or not, this girl is a hero!” says Hof, with the big-hearted whore-monger announcing that he was waiving his customary 50% cut of whatever Katherine earns from the auction, so the full $$$ amount could go toward helping her family. “When it comes to hymen auctions, I think it’s only right to let the girl keep 100% of the cash—call me old-fashioned, but that’s just me.”
When I woke up this morning I did not anticipate that I would be writing the words “hymen auctions.” #WhyIWrite
While Katherine awaits her hymen auction, she is still “contracted by Hof to legally provide services to gentlemen who are seeking experiences” other than intercourse, she said. “I have done small simple parties. Massage parties, stuff that has been very PG-13. My first experience I had here was the scariest one. It was all really new.”

When people question Katherine over not losing her for love, she has an answer. 
“People say you are suppose to do it for love, but if you think about it, I am doing it because I love my family.”
The Hof defends Katherine’s right to choose. 
“It is her choice. I don’t think it is a good idea for a girl to drink six tequilas and lose her virginity on the bathroom floor in a frat house … If she wants to (sell) it, I think that’s great.”
At the moment, the highest bid for her virginity is $400,000, but she says the highest bidder might not be the winner. 
“I’m waiting for a man who I feel a connection with so that the experience can be special for both of us,” she says. “It’s really not just about the money.”
Katherine, who one day dreams of one day becoming a lawyer, says she has no intentions of leaving the ranch after she pops her pricey cherry. “I anticipate to continue working at the ranch for the next five years,” she says. “I plan to go to law school in the future.”

A skinny salad sounds like a given. But...
Some salads can be waistline busters (especially from restaurants or fast food places) thanks to jumbo sizing and an overload of high-cal ingredients. But if you skip certain ingredients, like dressing or protein, your salad will be too skimpy, making you prone to hunger pangs soon after. So what are the ideal ingredients to get that perfect healthy mix? Here's what Digest Diet author Liz Vaccariello suggests, and what studies show can help with weight loss:
1. Use an oil-based salad dressing.
istock/oonal
Here's why: Many nutrients—specifically vitamins A, D, E, and K—are fat soluble, which means your body can’t absorb and use them without some fat present. So a fat-free dressing is actually counterintuitive! In fact, a recent Iowa State University study found that people who ate salads dressed with a canola or olive oil-based dressing had higher levels of carotenoids (vitamin A-like compounds) in their blood. Plus, ample research shows these unsaturated fatty acids can help melt belly fat and make your salad more filling. Even better? Toss the oil with vinegar, a proven fat releaser: Studies show it can help prevent blood sugar spikes after meals.
2. Mix up your greens.
istock/Metkalova
Every type of green—romaine, radicchio, iceberg, spinach—boasts its own unique nutrients and healthy benefits. For optimal nutrition, mix 'em up (either within the same bowl, or from day to day). Also consider adding some herbs, like basil or parsley; they pack a strong punch of flavor and loads of disease-fighting antioxidants. And the more flavorful your salad naturally is, the fewer high-cal ingredients you’ll need to add for taste.
3. Say yes to cheese.
istock/anandaBGD
When sprinkled in moderation, low-fat cheese helps people maintain a healthy weight, burn fat, and be less hungry, because it's a rich source of calcium, which helps release fat. I like paper-thin slices of parmesan, a few balls of creamy mozzarella cheese, or some shredded cheddar.
4. Lean on protein.
4. Lean on protein.
Whether you choose grilled chicken or salmon, edamame or tofu, or nuts or seeds, you'll release fat and feel more full. Stick to a healthy serving size to keep calories in check (a few ounces of meat, or a quarter cup of beans).
5. Throw in plenty of other veggies and fruits.
istock/aloha_17
Research shows that many vitamins and minerals have unique synergistic effects—meaning that they’re even more powerful when eaten together. So pack your salad with as many other veggies or fruits as possible! Carrots, cucumbers, different colored peppers, broccoli, peas, artichokes, strawberries, raspberries, or pears are great choices to get in different textures as well as plenty of filling fiber.
6. ... And skip the croutons!
istock/jastrijebphoto
White-bread croutons have few nutrients and a high glycemic load, which means they cause a sharp spike in blood sugar. Instead, satisfy your craving for crunch with nuts or seeds and different veggies. Still want carbs? I like to add brown rice or protein-packed quinoa, which research shows decreases body fat and overall food consumption.

Investigators in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province say a woman drove her 6-year-old stepdaughter, Reem Al Rashidi, to a remote area and slit her throat in broad daylight.
According to the Irish Mirror, at around 8:45 a.m. on Monday, October 3, a woman – who has yet to be identified – went to her stepdaughters’ school in Al Ahsa and pretended to be her mother, using a family identification card, in order to take her out of school for the day.
According to Saudi rules, a student may leave school grounds with a relative if they provide the school with a family photo, which would prove the “child belongs to them.”
The woman, who is believed to be in her 30s, was actually Rashidi’s stepmother – not her biological mother as she portrayed to school administrators – and she is her father’s second wife.

— Daily Mirror (@DailyMirror) October 7, 2016
Rashidi’s father – who has not been named — is married to three women and they all live together in the same house.
The first-grader was only able to execute a few activities with her classmates before she was taken out of the school and driven to a remote location in the district of Al-Mahasen.
Her stepmother stated that she was going to take the child home but unbeknownst to the school staff, she had sinister plans.
After arriving at the remote location, the pair exited the vehicle and that’s when Rashidi’s stepmother allegedly slit her throat with a knife she kept hidden in her clothing.
The brutal murder took place in broad daylight, which allowed an unnamed man who was close by to witness the gruesome scene.
The witness told reporters that he tried desperately to stop the woman from slitting the 6-year-old girl’s throat but it was to no avail.
Afterward, the stepmother fled the scene, leaving the girl’s body behind in a pool of her own blood.
The Saudi citizen immediately alerted the police about the alleged murder and they were later dispatched to the scene.
When emergency responders arrived at the scene, the girl was pronounced dead.
The woman was later captured after the witness directed police to the house the stepmother was hiding in, and she was arrested on murder charges.

It was later alleged that before the girl’s body was identified, her relatives reported her missing. When they went to Rashidi’s school, school administrators informed them that she had already been picked by her biological mother earlier that day, but her relatives knew that wasn’t the case.
Not long after reporting the child missing, they received devastating news — the girl was killed in an isolated location when her stepmother allegedly slit her throat.
Investigators have yet to uncover a motive for the brutal murder, but several social media users believe that she may have been jealous of the child. “Maybe the stepmother have psychological problems or I say she is insane,” commented Lani Harim on Facebook.
Another social media user, Sarah, added, “She is the stepmother and a second wife as well, I think she did it because of jealousy. But it doesn’t mean that she’s allowed to kill or murder this innocent kid. Why not kill his husband?
“This is a lesson to those women and to the man as well. To be aware if they have multiple wives like this. People nowadays are getting worse.”
“It’s a sick world we’re living in, with some very sick people. A life that should never have been wasted,” said one Twitter user.
A police spokesperson stated that after receiving “a call from a Saudi citizen reporting the killing. The suspect, a Saudi woman in her 30s, was arrested and the case was referred to the public prosecutor for investigation.”
An investigation is ongoing.

 NEWPORT NEWS — You can make out their distinctive profiles – massive, gray, flat-topped hulls, each with an “island” bearing big-block numbers – from miles away, such familiar sights as to be nearly taken for granted.
 Yet they’re the Navy’s crown jewels, five of them homeported in Hampton Roads.
 Since the 1920s, more than 60 U.S. aircraft carriers have been built, 30 of them at Newport News Shipbuilding. Among the more famous – maybe the most famous – was the USS Enterprise, The Big “E,” the world’s first nuclear-powered carrier, launched in September 1960.
 Today, it’s back where it was built, in the home stretch of defueling its reactors – the first phase in the process that will lead to its eventual dismantlement.
 Even in the face of its own impending demise, as it were, the ship may be breathing life back in the direction of its creator, positioning the shipyard for a business opportunity as big as the Enterprise itself: helping to break down and dispose of carriers and their reactors – not just building, defueling and refueling them.
 The shipyard won a $745 million Navy contract for the inactivation of the Enterprise three years ago and is expected to complete the defueling work around next spring. Because it’s the first nuclear-powered carrier to be “inactivated” – prepared for its pending disposal – it presents a new set of challenges to its builder and the Navy.
 “We’re learning a lot,” said Chris Miner, vice president of in-service carrier programs at Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding.
 The yard has its eye, down the road, on the inactivation of the carrier Nimitz. The lead ship in the class of 10 nuclear-powered carriers is scheduled to start that process about 2025.
 Because none of the conventionally powered carriers that moved into retirement before the Enterprise posed radiological issues, they wound up all over the place. Many were simply scrapped; some were sunk deliberately as targets or for other purposes, like creating a reef. Some are now museums or in play to become one.
 The Enterprise has to be disposed of very differently because of the eight nuclear reactors in its midsection, which even after defueling, still bear some radioactivity.
 The first step requires removing the fuel, a process with which the Newport News yard is very familiar.
 It has refueled the Enterprise three times during its career, as well as refueling four of the 10 Nimitz-class carriers launched since 1972. The fifth in the class, the Abraham Lincoln, is nearing the end of that process now; the sixth, the George Washington, is next.
 Newport News also has significant experience refueling nuclear submarines and has been involved in some of their inactivations as well.
 “There’s a lot of similarities in some of the work, but it is different because instead of refueling the ship, you’re actually positioning it for disposal,” Miner said.
 Four years ago, the Navy planned to tow the defueled Enterprise around South America, to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility in Bremerton, Wash., the proverbial graveyard for Navy nuclear-powered ships.
 After the Enterprise’s arrival in Bremerton, its reactors would be removed and barged to a Department of Energy site in Hanford, Wash., to be deposited in a special trench.
 The rest of the vessel would be recycled in Bremerton.
 Two years ago, however, the plan began to shift.
 In May 2014, the Navy issued a request for information, an invitation to industry to brainstorm about how best to dismantle everything on the Enterprise except its nuclear reactors and related propulsion spaces.
 In recent emails to The Pilot, the Navy said the 2012 plan, as first laid out, had been rethought.
 The Enterprise dwarfs the defueled submarines commonly recycled at the Puget facility: At sea, the carrier displaced more than 95,000 tons of water, compared with the 7,800 tons of a Los Angeles-class submarine.
 When the Navy began to do the math, it became clear that doing the complete recycling of the Enterprise at Puget wasn’t going to work, affecting the yard’s ability to do the highest-priority fleet maintenance work it’s charged with executing.
 Once that picture came into view, the Navy shifted its focus to commercially recycling the non-nuclear sections of the Enterprise and isolating its eight reactor plants and related spaces, sealing them into a unit it calls a “propulsion space section.”
 While the original idea was to ship the reactor-plant package back to Bremerton, where the reactors would be barged to the Hanford site, that, too, could change.
 The Navy said last week that it issued another request for information in August, asking private industry to weigh in on possible approaches to dismantling and disposing of the sealed reactors.
 The solicitation of bids for the breaking down and recycling of the rest of the Enterprise – and forming and sealing the reactor compartments and related propulsion spaces into a separate package – is already on the street.
 The Navy issued a request for proposal, setting that chain of events in motion, during the summer. The bids are due Nov. 4. The contractor will be allowed to keep “the proceeds of the sale of scrap metals and reusable items to offset its costs of performance,” according to the request.
 The work is expected to be done between September 2017 and September 2019.
 What happens to the propulsion space section still is an open question.
 While some industry sources maintain that the Enterprise’s sealed reactor-compartment package will end up in Bremerton, the Navy said in an email last week that it will consider the disposal of the propulsion space section at sites other than Puget Sound.
 If it pursued that option, the Navy would deliver the sealed reactors to the site, on the condition that “all reactor plant dismantlement, radioactive waste disposal, and non-radioactive ship dismantling and recycling work (is) accomplished at a facility meeting all applicable requirements” within the United States, the Navy email said.
 Miner said that Newport News Shipbuilding is an interested party and brings to the table more than its years of experience building and tending to nuclear carriers and submarines..
 U.S. Navy Naval History and Heritage Command
 In early 2014, its parent company, Huntington Ingalls, broadened its nuclear portfolio by acquiring Colorado-based S.M. Stoller Corp., a provider of environmental, nuclear and technical consulting and engineering services to the U.S. Department of Energy and other customers.
 The company’s website cites the government’s Hanford facility – where Navy reactors have been disposed of – as one of the places where Stoller has experience.
 Early last year, Huntington Ingalls announced it had created a new subsidiary – Stoller Newport News Nuclear, or “SN3” – a full-service nuclear operations and environmental services company that combined Stoller and Newport News Nuclear, another of its subsidiaries.
 Miner said the addition of the company’s SN3 unit enables Huntington Ingalls to offer the Navy an attractive package for handling future carrier dismantlements.
 “We certainly see there’s an opportunity and we’re interested in it,” he added.
 While Miner alluded to other “industry partners” without identifying them, Defense News reported last year that they could include several companies in Brownsville, Texas, on the Gulf Coast, that specialize in cutting up and recycling old ships.
 If the Enterprise were towed to Brownsville, its dismantling would include the creation of the propulsion space section, the sealed unit containing the ship’s reactors and related spaces.
 It would then be delivered by the Navy to Puget Sound or wherever else the Navy determined the work could be safely done.
 Over the past three years, the Navy has awarded contracts to International Shipbreaking, All Star Metals and ESCO Marine to tow five conventional carriers – the Forrestal, Saratoga, Ranger, Independence and Constellation – to Brownsville for scrapping.
 The amount of the awards has ranged from a penny to $6 million.
 Why the huge variation?
 Two of the ships were towed from the East Coast, while the other three were hauled from Bremerton, Wash., requiring trips around South America, industry sources said.
 The companies make their money through the sale of the metal they harvest.
 Wherever else the Enterprise may be dismantled, there’s no chance it would be done at its Virginia home.
 “Newport News is not pursuing dismantling the Enterprise here at our facility,” Miner said. “I’ll just put it straight up: That’s not something we are pursuing.”

f3c3b556,http://odili.net/news/source/2016/oct/23/332.html,The Internet:,"SUDDENLY, health pages have turned into a must-read portion of newspapers and journals. No self-respecting editor dares publish without feeding his readers on what to eat and do to make life worth living, and what items to give the wide berth if you don't want to swell the coffers of your doctor. Lately, there'd been a deluge of advice on the merit of staying away from mobile phones. According to these 'experts,' mobile phones are dangerous to men because they lower men's sperm count. ""Nobody's sperm count could persuade me to give up my mobile and shackle myself to the old wire and dial model,"" protest Esther, a writer. ""If the men are so worried, instead of thrusting their mobiles deep into their pockets, why don't they take up handbags instead? 
My phone nestles in my bag, accompanying me wherever I go, linking me to my friends, family and the world."" 
The Vatican once threw its hat in the ring of anti-mobile users. During the Lenten period, it urged believers to give up sending text messages and use the phone! Words fail me at the importance of this message. Suffice it to say that public indignation had more than shown how unpopular this penance was! 
The bra is another item that could be in danger of being banned because there's a possibility they give women breast cancer! I mean how can your boobs be possibly bad for your health? ""How could a lace sling designed to counteract gravity and give extra bounce have the sinister effect of blocking my lymph glands, so causing cancer? The medics should consider the dangers of banning bras,"" says Esther, a cosmetologist in her 30s. ""Millions of female joggers would run the risk of serious black eyes. It would also be a disaster for the retail trade. What would the husbands do at Christmas without the thrill of buying something quite unsuitable in red or shocking pink for their wives? And where would the advertising industry be without a cleavage feature on hoardings?"" 
As for deodorants, they're supposed to contain carcinogenic chemicals, and to avoid the damaging effects, you're advised to go natural-a giant leap back to the prehistoric days where you allow hair to grow and perspiration runs free. According to Esther:""That might have been bearable in those olden days, when reliance consisted of a knock on the head with a wooden club, and people lived in caves full of bat droppings. But imagine rush-hour, or the cinema, or a long haul flight without deodorants. Life might last longer but would it be worth living?"" Here are other tongue-in-check comments on other ""vices"" you should give up: 
Cars: They pollute, they kill people, and roads destroy the countryside. But in return, they give us freedom, independence and somewhere to put the shopping. Actually, no matter how much harm cars do, they'll never be banned because men are addicted to them. They use their cars the way Medieval Man used his codpiece to inflate his ego. 
Babies: A gynaecologist was once asked what single thing a woman could do to prolong her life and hang on to her youth. He said:""avoid having babies. Child birth damages a woman's body as badly as a car crash."" Once your baby is born, there's no let up. Years of sleeplessness gives you indelible wrinkles. Babies throw up on the shoulder of your expensive dress. They develop a high fever just as you're about to go out. Then they give you that gummy grin and fall asleep on your chest, breathing out that special fragrance of talcum and baby oil. Irresistible! 
 We're constantly warned about new dangers. You can be deluged with junk mail, harassed by pornography, conned by fraudsters or lured by paedophiles. But it unites the world and leaps over all barriers or frontiers. With one click, every reference book is open to you, you can trawl through history or literature, indulge your favourite hobby, meet friends or find true love. We'd be isolated and ignorant without it. 
Milk Chocolate: It's supposed to be crammed with fat so it's bad heart, it's almost pure sugar so it rots your teeth; and if it's made in England, it contains practically no real chocolate. Who cares? In the 18th Century; chocolate was banned because it makes you feel so good. As a mood enhancer; it's far better than gin. 
Stiletto heels: They shorten your tendons, dig holes in wooden floors, get impaled in grass and break when you run. They have no practical use, but they flatter the fattest ankle and lengthen the shortest leg. Beauty queens have always known their power-so no wonder it's become fashionable to wear with bikinis. 
Men: Physically and emotionally, there is no doubt that men are dangerous. We can contract diseases from them and have our hearts broken by them. There are compensations, however. They can open a bottle of champagne better than most women. And if the right man pays you a compliment, it will put a sparkle in your eyes more effectively than cosmetic surgery. 
Easy steps to making a decision: ""Get in touch with your values. What are you like when you are at your best?"" so asks a Psychologist. What kind of passion do you want to be? Assess all the facts; what you specifically want to happen, what's interpretation and what's truth. 
Analyse your feelings and become clear on what they are. See if the big question breaks down into separate sub-issues, each of which might benefit from a fresh solution. Phrase each issue as a question, starting: ""How to … "" or ""in what ways might I."" Mentally follow both decision paths and compare results. 
For each, keep asking, ""and why is that important to me?"" to see which leads 
you closer to your own values. 
Don't canvass opinions from others. Stop. Step back; go for a walk somewhere beautiful; wait. Try out each decision internally and see how it feels. Put a time frame on this; decide to look at it again in a few hours or days. Act- and ""own the outcome of your decision. Accept that it was your choice made freely and, with due consideration."" 
Married or single, which would you prefer? 
If you're single, you imagine all your problems would be solved if you had a partner. If you're in a relationship, you might wonder if life would be more exciting on your own. But when it comes to sex, is it better when you're single or is there something about a relationship that makes sex more intense? 
Single Sex: Singletons can enjoy casual sex with no strings attached. You can sleep with who you like when you like. You're free to enjoy the moment and may not think too much about the future. Sex can be spontaneous, carefree and exciting. 
You can have sex with somebody you know, but sex with a stranger can be more of a thrill as it can be easier to lose our inhibitions. 
Casual sex is seen as risky and naughty and can give deep physical satisfaction. It can also leave you emotionally empty. They are only life-affirming if both of you want the same. 
Be sure to protect yourself and your lovers from sexually-transmitted infection and pregnancy by using good contraception and condoms every time you have sex. 
Couple Sex: Most relationships go through an intense period at first when you can't keep your hands off each other. 
Because you've invested more in each other emotionally, the sexual highs and sense of fulfilment are immense. But the stakes are high and you risk greater heartache if things go wrong. 
After about a year, the intensity of sex and the passion changes. You know your partner and it's difficult to shut out the more mundane things in your life. 
What you get instead is a sense of satisfaction with life as you feel more secure in your relationship. But you can't get complacent. Without working at your love life, nights together can soon become mundane and routine.

Matthews told him saying something like that is pretty “tricky.” Schilling complained to Matthews tonight about how apparently some people have called him anti-Semitic over this, saying he didn’t see anything wrong with asking Tapper to explain why there are so many Jews who vote Democratic.
He said it was genuine curiosity on his part because “this country feels so anti-Israel” recently.
Matthews told him, “The problem is… you can’t ask a person of a religious faith or a race to speak for that religious group and ask them to sort of account for it.”

It sure seems like an odd time to be provoking a war with Russia.
As I write this, we stand just a little bit more than three weeks away from one of the most pivotal elections in U.S. history, and Barack Obama has chosen this moment to strongly threaten the Russians.
As I wrote on Friday, Reuters is reporting that Obama is contemplating ""direct U.S. military action"" against Syrian military targets, and the Russians have already indicated that any assault on Syrian forces would be considered an attack on themselves.
The rapidly deteriorating crisis in Syria has already caused tensions with Russia to rise to the highest level since the end of the Cold War, but now Obama is adding fuel to the fire by publicly considering ""an unprecedented cyber covert action against Russia."" Apparently Obama believes that Russian hackers are interfering in the election and so he wants payback.
The following comes from an NBC News article titled ""CIA Prepping for Possible Cyber Strike Against Russia.""
The Obama administration is contemplating an unprecedented cyber covert action against Russia in retaliation for alleged Russian interference in the American presidential election, U.S. intelligence officials told NBC News.
Current and former officials with direct knowledge of the situation say the CIA has been asked to deliver options to the White House for a wide-ranging ""clandestine"" cyber operation designed to harass and ""embarrass"" the Kremlin leadership.
The sources did not elaborate on the exact measures the CIA was considering, but said the agency had already begun opening cyber doors, selecting targets and making other preparations for an operation.
Somebody should tell Obama that he is not playing a video game. A cyber attack is considered to be an act of war, and the Russians would inevitably retaliate. And considering how exceedingly vulnerable our cyber infrastructure is, I don't know if that is something that we want to invite.
At the end of last week, Vice President Joe Biden also publicly threatened the Russians:
On Friday, Vice President Joe Biden met ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd for an interview that has raised serious concern in Russia.
Without bothering to question the authenticity of the claims, Todd took the allegations of Russian hacking at face value, opening his interview with a loaded question: ""Why haven't we sent a message yet to Putin?""
After a moment of stunned silence, Biden responded, ""We're sending a message. We have the capacity to do it and it will be at the time of our choosing, and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact.""
When Todd asked if the public will know a message was sent, Biden replied, ""Hope not.""
The Russians firmly deny that they had any involvement in the hacking, and so far the Obama administration has not publicly produced any firm evidence that the Russians were behind it.
Perhaps the Obama administration privately has some evidence, but at this point they have not shown that evidence to the American public.
So for Joe Biden to be making these sorts of threats is a very dangerous thing. The Russians are taking these threats very seriously, and they are preparing to protect their interests:
'The threats directed against Moscow and our state's leadership are unprecedented because they are voiced at the level of the US vice president.
'To the backdrop of this aggressive, unpredictable line, we must take measures to protect (our) interests, to hedge risks,' a Kremlin spokesman said, according to RIA Novosti news agency.
Here in the United States, most people don't even realize we could be on the verge of a major conflict with Russia.
But over in Russia things are completely different. Talk of war is everywhere, and the potential for war is the No. 1 topic in the Russian media right now. Just check out some of the recent Russian media headlines about the conflict between our two nations:
""Bad News for Washington: Syrian Conflict Revealing New World Order""
""US Anti-Russia Rhetoric Goes Nuclear With Threats of Covert Cyber-Attacks""
""Who Can Win World War III if It Can Be Won at All?""
""In Contrast to Clinton, Trump Has No Appetite for War With Russia""
And one Russian television network recently instructed their viewers to locate the nearest bomb shelter in case a nuclear war between the United States and Russia suddenly erupts.
A terrifying Russian television broadcast explicitly told civilians to find out where their nearest bomb shelter is and repeatedly asked viewers if they were ready for nuclear war.
One apocalyptic broadcast told viewers on Moscow's state-owned TV channel NTV: ""If it should one day happen, every one of you should know where the nearest bomb shelter is. It's best to find out now.""
I don't believe that the Russians are crazy to be thinking that a war might be coming.
To me, it almost seems as though Obama wants one.
Could it be possible that a conflict with Russia will be used to alter, change or influence the upcoming election in November?
The truth is that it isn't going to take much for the shooting to begin. If Obama orders airstrikes against Syrian forces, the Russians have said they will shoot back.
Ash Carter has threatened Russia with ""consequences"". After blowing up the ceasefire, the Pentagon – supported by the Joint Chiefs of Staff — now is peddling ""potential strikes"" on Syria's air force to ""punish the regime"" for what the Pentagon actually did; blow up the ceasefire. One can't make this stuff up.
Major-General Igor Konashenkov, Russia's Defense Ministry spokesman, sent a swift message to ""our colleagues in Washington""; think twice if you believe you can get away with launching a ""shadow"" hot war against Russia. Russia will target any stealth/unidentified aircraft attacking Syrian government targets – and they will be shot down.
The only serious question then is whether an out of control Pentagon will force the Russian Air Force – false flag and otherwise — to knock out US Air Force fighter jets, and whether Moscow has the fire power to take out each and every one of them.
I discussed the potential for war with Russia in my latest video. Hopefully cooler heads will prevail and war with Russia will be put off.
But without a doubt, the crisis in Syria is not going to be resolved anytime soon because it is one giant mess.
Most people don't realize that the Syrian civil war has essentially been a proxy war between Sunni Islam and Shia Islam from the very beginning. Jihadi rebels that are armed and funded by Saudi Arabia and Turkey are fighting Hezbollah troops that are armed and funded by Iran. And now Turkish forces have invaded northern Syria, and this threatens to cause a full-blown war to erupt between Turkey and the Syrian Kurds. Of course ISIS is right in the middle of everything causing havoc, blowing stuff up and beheading anyone who doesn't believe in their radical version of Sunni Islam.
It is absolutely insane that the United States and Russia could potentially go to war because of this conflict. Both sides are determined to show the other how tough they are, and one false move could set off a spiral of events from which they may be no recovery.
The American people very foolishly elected Barack Obama twice, but up until now the consequences have not been quite as dire as many had been projecting.
However, right here at the end of his second term Obama is facing a moment of truth. If he ends up dragging us into a war with Russia, the American people will ultimately bitterly regret putting him into the White House.

701725b6,http://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/cooking-tips-techniques/how-to-make-perfect-scrambled-eggs?xid=soc_socialflow_twitter_realsimple,The One Mistake You’re Making With Your Scrambled Eggs,"Scrambled eggs are one of our favorite back-pocket breakfasts: the ingredients are always in the fridge, the kids love ’em, and they’re a great source of protein. But just because they’re easy to make doesn’t mean there’s no technique involved. In fact, there’s a significant difference between a soft, fluffy pile of eggs and a sad skillet of rubbery, over-cooked curds. If yours have been looking more like the latter, the reason is probably that you’re starting to scramble the eggs too soon and at too high of a heat. 
Though it’s tempting to start scrambling the eggs as soon as they hit the pan, the key to perfect eggs is letting them cook until they’re beginning to set around the edges before moving them around. “Just when those curds start to set, you just gently move them, and you end up with these big, fluffy, cloud-like curds,” says Chef Curtis Stone, a cookbook author and television personality. There’s never a need for vigorous stirring; instead, push them softly to the center of the pan with a rubber spatula, tilt the pan back so the uncooked eggs run back, and repeat until they’re creamy and almost cooked through. “Take the eggs off before they’re fully cooked, because they continue to cook even once they’re on the plate,” Stone says. Keep the pan on a low heat throughout the entirety of the cooking process.
 Feeling indulgent? Whisk a good dose of cream into the eggs before adding them to the pan—a luxurious version Stone calls his “weekend” scrambled eggs. And once you’ve mastered the art of scrambling, try upgrading your eggs with these delicious toppings.

But I’m guessing you probably haven’t seen ornaments like these.
One Esty seller is going viral for making the one thing that’s always been missing from your holiday tree: colorful felt vaginas.
Feltmelons is an Etsy shop that sells glorious handmade “vaginaments.”
Shop owner Suzanne McAleenan makes the cutesy hoo-has from colored felt and artfully placed miniature sleigh bells that you can jingle and jangle to your heart’s content — because every lady likes to have her bell jingled, amirite?
The ornaments are available different sizes and colors, so you can make sure you get a tree vulva that represents your honey pot on a deeper level. McAleenan also boasts that she sews each one by hand, so “no two will look exactly alike. Just like in the real world!”
The vaginaments were featured on Metro over the weekend and went insanely viral.
McAleenan was forced to temporarily close her shop to contend with the volume of orders.
It seems everyone is trying to snatch these snatches. Luckily, the shop reopens tomorrow, so you can order fanciful vulvas for everyone on your list. You’ll want to order them asap too, because they’re made in Canada and most orders take about 18 days to ship.
If you want to make sure your vajayjay tree has all the trappings, FeltMelons also sells these delightfully perky boob ornaments.
Clearly, decking the halls with boughs of holly is so totally last season.
If you’re in need of a conversation starter for your next holiday party, you want a White Elephant gift that won’t end up in the trash, or you just feel like Christmas is seriously lacking in pussy power (it SO is), then a merry little Vagina-mas is just what you need.

8b81f3c4,http://www.lifehack.org/355818/this-what-happens-when-you-drink-only-water-for-30-days,This Is What Happens When You Drink Only Water For 30 Days,"The body—each molecular cell, tissue, and organ—relies upon water to remain alive and workable. Water provides a kind of health therapy, along with sustaining your life. It greatly impacts specific body operations and the maintenance of good health.
When you only drink water as your primary beverage, outstanding things can happen. Undertaking a special water regimen is not easily achievable for some, but positive consequences are possible. Here’s what can happen when you drink only water for 30 days, without changing your diet or exercise routine.
Your mental creativity and performance will be boosted
When you drink only water for 30 days, your brain reacts faster, according to the Frontiers in Human Neuroscience Journal. As the brain needs tons of oxygen to operate efficiently, and water is one of the great sources, your brainpower will be boosted. It helps you think and help you focus. Also it makes you keen, clever, and quick. Ingesting 8 to 10 cups of water per day can improve your cognitive performance by as much as 30%.
You’ll age more slowly than your peers
Drinking water helps decelerate the aging process by keeping your skin adequately hydrated. It moisturizes your skin, keeps it healthy, soft, plump, glowing, youthful, and wrinkle-free. It helps maintain muscle tone, also. To realize these benefits, you must drink pure water.
In an article published by the Daily Mail, a 42-year-old mother managed to make herself appear 10 years younger in 30 days by drinking only water. She started by drinking three liters of water a day to overcome her long-standing headaches and poor digestion dilemma. After only one month, she was absolutely stunned by the spectacular results. Both of her problems were resolved, and she fully recovered from the effects of chronic dehydration.
She announced, “I genuinely can’t believe the difference in my face. I look like a different woman. The dark shadows around my eyes have all but disappeared and the blotches have gone. My skin is almost as dewy as it was when I was a child. The transformation is nothing short of remarkable… I’m feeling leaner and fitter, too, which is amazing, since the only thing I’ve changed is the amount of water I drink.”
Your immunity will be strengthened
A Slovakian Proverb says “Pure water is the world’s first and foremost medicine.”
That is no exaggeration! Water behaves as a catalyst for the renewal of optimal body functions. Drinking adequate amounts of water supports the performance of your liver and kidneys. These organs eliminate toxic substances, waste, and salt from your blood.
FullFitSure asserts that sufficient water consumption neutralizes pH levels, strengthens your immunity against kidney stones and other illnesses, and supports pain management (body aches and headaches), too.
You’ll have a stronger heart
Water helps you become heart healthy. It decreases the threat of a heart attack by preventing your blood from thickening, and by lowering your blood pressure.
One glass of water an hour before bed is said to prevent a heart attack or stroke. It makes it easier for the heart to send freshly oxygenated blood to the organs. The American Journal of Epidemiology published a six-year study that found that people who drank more than five glasses of water a day were 41% less likely to die from a heart attack than those who drank less than two glasses a day.
Your bones will be strengthened
Water helps rebuild shock absorber cartilage, so joints can move smoothly, curtailing joint damage triggered by tension. Testimonies give evidence that joint flexibility improves with adequate intake of water.
You’ll lose fat
When you drink only water for 30 days, your body removes irritable, harmful toxins and waste products from your vital organs. This makes your body cleaner and helps trim belly fat.
In the beginning, an increase in pounds could become a concern if your body is retaining water before adjusting to the higher intake consumption. Even so, acting as an appetite suppressant, water comes to the rescue. You’ll soon begin to consume fewer calories, lose weight, and keep it off, because the water flushes out your system, cleansing your body and reducing your hunger.
Andrea N. Giancoli, MPH, RD, and spokesperson for The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, submits that drinking one or two glasses of water before a meal can fill you up so you naturally eat less. Consuming water at regular intervals will assist with your weight management.
Your metabolism will be enhanced
Studies suggest that consistently drinking water during each day stimulates a more dynamic metabolism, regardless of your diet. Consuming 16 ounces of water just after awaking in the mornings raises your metabolism by 24%, according to the Health Fitness Revolution.

10e665b3,http://theberry.com/2016/10/10/breastfeeding-is-completely-ridiculous/?utm_source=sumome&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=sumome_share,9 Ridiculous Breastfeeding Stories From New Moms,"When I started breastfeeding my baby girl, it felt like a very intimate, quiet and sacred act– minutes in time where my baby and I were completely connected both physically and emotionally. It wasn’t soon before I realized that breastfeeding has another side, a side that is totally, completely, rid-honkin-diculous.
I was in the shower, enjoying the hot water on my exhausted muscles, enjoying having some time to myself while my husband cared for his newborn daughter. My breasts were enormous, engorged still with the first flood of milk that comes in the days after childbirth. I was washing the soap out of my hair when my husband yanked open the shower curtain to tell me something, and I turned toward him and blasted him from both breasts with breastmilk: Austin Power Femmebot style. It was both mortifying and hilarious. I’m not the only one…
1. When this mom treated herself to a cocktail.
“I had chronic low milk supply. I went to a country concert when H was probably 2 months old, and I pumped my tiny amount of milk in the parking lot while tail gating. Back then I didn’t know pump and dump wasn’t necessary, and I couldn’t bring myself to dump the milk, so I drank it, while everyone else was pounding alcohol.” -Kelly B.
2. When this tired new mother tried to feed a pillow.
“With my first I was so sleep deprived from waking and nursing the baby every two hours. I would start having dreams that I had nursed the baby, which was really confusing because then I couldn’t remember whether I had actually nursed him or not. One time I thought I was nursing the baby only to wake up and realize I had been asleep and was holding a pillow to my breast trying to breastfeed it. The baby was sound asleep in his bassinet.” -Kristel A.
3. When this busy mom was doing double duty.
“I once breastfed my own baby at work because he refused to take a bottle and my mom brought him up to the hospital in tears. I was mandated (required to work over the shift I had signed up for, so it ended up being a 14 hour shift instead of the four hour shift I signed up to work specifically because he didn’t take a bottle, reason #1487 I hated working at the hospital) because we were so short and I have never been so stressed in my life, literally trying to choose between work and my screaming baby. My manager gave me permission to feed him, but I couldn’t leave the nursery because we had a sick baby, so I held my son in one arm and nursed him while running IV meds for this poor baby in the nursery.” -Chauncie B.
4. When a parade of clueless dudes just couldn’t stay away.
“My first day back at work (teaching) after having my first child, I got walked in on three times (all males) because they didn’t know the previous theater closet was now the lactation room. They all apologized and then turned to leave, which was fine. However, the last time, a very awkward physics teacher got his key stuck in the door, so he opened the door back open really wide and said, ‘My key is stuck. Can you come over and help me?’
Also, last year, I forgot my pump one day and had to milk myself into a coffee cup. It was a really mothering-up moment.” -Katie A.
5. When this distracted mother let it all hang out.
“When my oldest was about two months old, I was dangerously sleep deprived because I was nursing every two hours and then pumping for 20 minutes in an attempt to increase my milk supply. One morning, after my husband woke me as he was leaving for work, I got up as usual and made breakfast, got on Facebook and did a little housework before I realized I had never put one of my breasts “away’ after nursing my daughter last.” -Mary S.
6. When a waiter got free show—and shower.
“The first time we went out to eat after Owen was born – he was a couple months old I guess – and we were seated in a booth across from one another.
I was nursing Owen when the – teenage male – waiter came to take our drink orders.
 The new voice caught Owen’s attention and he ‘popped off’ to look and my milk sprayed clear across the table !!
The poor waiter blushed SO much !
We had a different waiter the rest of the meal.” -Lea A.
7. When a corpse got involved.
“One time I was at a funeral home and Lorelei (maybe eight months old) needed to nurse. I was all set to nurse her in the “viewing” room but for some reason my mother got weird about it so I went to ask the funeral director for a more secluded location. He ushered me into another room saying, “Mr. Smith is the only one in here and HE WON’T MIND!” So it was just me, Lorelei, and some random dead man.” -Leslie S.
8. When this mom went off like a fountain.
“I was breast feeding my baby Anthony during the O.J. Simpson white bronco chase, glued to the TV with a bunch of friends from high school over to ‘meet’ my baby- when he came off the boob and milk was squirting across the room for quite awhile before anyone noticed.” -Misty N.
9. When carpooling with the boss got interesting.
“Pumping in the car while on a business trip while your boss drives…trying to hide under the nursing blanket with the incessant noise, burrrr…chhhh…burrr…chhhh… Hahaha…lovely drive home from Los Angeles.  #fulltimeworkingmomprobs and still managed to exclusively breast feed for 13 months! Woo woo!” -Christine J.

His new girlfriend demanded that they live in Jake and Edith’s multi-million dollar home. Since Jake had better lawyers, he prevailed. He gave Edith, his now ex-wife, just 3 days to move out. 
She spent the 1st day packing her belongings into boxes and crates. 
On the 2nd day, she had two movers come and collect her things. 
On the 3rd day, she sat down for the last time at their beautiful dining room table by candlelight, put on some soft background music, and feasted on a pound of shrimp, a jar of caviar and a bottle of Chardonnay. 
When she had finished, she went into each and every room and stuffed half-eared shrimp shells dipped in caviar into the hollow of all the curtain rods. She then cleaned up the kitchen and left. 
When Jake returned with his new girlfriend, all was bliss for the first few days. 
Then slowly, the house began to smell. They tried everything- cleaning, mopping, and airing the place out. Vents were checked for dead rodents and carpets were cleaned. Air fresheners were hung everywhere. Exterminators were brought in to set off gas canisters during which they had to move out for a few days and in the end they even replaced the expensive wool carpeting. Nothing worked. 
People stopped coming over to visit. Repairmen refused to work in the house. The maid quit. 
Finally, they could not take the stench any longer and decided to move. 
A month later, even though they had cut their price in half, they could not find a buyer for their stinky house. Word got out and eventually even the local Realtor refused to return their calls. Finally they had to borrow a huge sum of money from the bank to purchase a new place.
Edith called Jake and asked how things were going. He told her the saga of the rotting house. She listened politely and said that she missed her old home terribly and would be willing to reduce her divorce settlement in exchange for getting the house back. 
Knowing his ex-wife had no idea how bad the smell was, he agreed on a price that was about 1/10th of what the house had been worth, but only if she were the sign the papers that very day. She agreed and within the hour, his lawyers delivered the paperwork. 
A week later, Jake and his girlfriend stood smiling as they watched the moving company pack everything to take to their new home...

Chips are it! Chloe Khan proved she does not need caviar or lobster to be wooed as she enjoyed a drive-thru McDonald's with her rumoured beau Ashley Cain before a Justin Bieber concert in London on Wednesday night
Chloe, who soared to fame following a failed X Factor stint in 2010, has returned to prominence in recent months after a stint in CBB in which she got up close and personal with co-star Stephen Bear.
The mother-of-one slipped into a chic khaki dress with a plunging neckline which was tenuously held together by a raunchy lace-up string which heaved beneath her eye-popping assets.
Adding a designer touch to the look was Chloe's cream Louis Vuitton bucket bag attached by a long strap, while matching her teetering heels.
She styled her hair in a voluminous beehive with loose curls falling down her back in her usual perfectly styled look. Her make-up meanwhile was heavy-handed yet perfectly applied.

The former footballer escorted his lady friend in a plush neon car which they were no doubt cautious not to suffer any McDonald's spillage on.
As they tucked into their calorific treats, Ashley decided to romantically dangle a handful of chips into Chloe's mouth while she giggled and clutched a drink.
The pair first puckered up for a snog during the National Reality TV Awards late last month before they later packed on the PDA once again during a night out at Cafe De Paris in London the following week.

Despite her whirlwind union with Ashley, Chloe has had quite the lively romantic history, particularly during this year's CBB where she started a brief yet saucy romance with housemate Bear.
The Leeds-born lass first found fame when she appeared on X Factor under the name Chloe Victoria (soon to become Mafia) sporting a very different appearance.
The former aspiring singer, who is mother to daughter Destiny, then had a complete makeover in 2015, re-branding herself as Chloe Khan.

This was the terrifying message a couple overheard on their 3-year-old’s baby monitor after he fearfully complained about someone talking to him at night.
After that message, the mother said that she heard someone say, ""look someone's coming"" or ""someone's coming into view” when she walked into her son’s room. At that moment, she realized that a stranger was controlling the camera remotely.
""Well, I started to cry in there, because it all started coming back to me, and I started figuring things out,” the mother said to CBS New York.
The couple became more suspicious after that and began to notice that the monitor moved when they weren’t controlling it and the night vision lens followed them when they moved, leading them to the conclusion that a stranger had hacked the baby monitor and used it to spy on their son and talk to him.
Both parents have asked to remain anonymous due to fear of the hacker learning their identities.
They reported the incident to Foscam, the company where they bought the baby monitor, but there’s no way for them to know who exactly had hacked it.
Many new baby monitors can connect to the Internet and may also come with Smartphone apps, making them easier to hack. Technology experts have warned about this danger, as other families have had their privacy invaded as well.
A family in Minnesota realized that their monitor had been hacked after photos of their baby appeared online.
In April, Fox 19 reported a story of a man who had hacked a baby monitor in Ohio and used it to scream, “Wake up baby. Wake up baby,” at an infant named Heather who had been asleep in her crib.
""You do kind of feel violated in a way,"" said Heather’s father Adam to Fox 19.
Lance Ulanoff, chief correspondent for the digital media website Mashable, has recommended that families change the default password of their monitors after purchase.
""If somebody else has your login information, they can go to that same app, and log into your webcam, which is what happened here,"" said Ulanoff.

21e3cf17,https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidmack/latina-contra-eric-trump?utm_term=.jbWMVyRnK#.ofoKPOqNn,These Latina Sisters Trolled Eric Trump With A Simple T-Shirt,"“I thought ‘contra’ was pretty clear, but I guess not.”

Meet sisters Annie and Ceci Cardelle, who live in Salisbury, North Carolina.

The Latina sisters, 23 and 17, are second-generation Americans of Cuban descent, as well as supporters of Hillary Clinton.

On Friday, Eric Trump and his wife Lara visited North Carolina to help drum up support for his dad.

When the sisters found out the Trumps were holding an event in their hometown, Ceci said she messaged her sister to say, “Oh my God, we have to go.”

“I was against it,” Annie told BuzzFeed News. “I didn’t want to go hear Eric Trump speak, but she really wanted to, so I couldn’t just go without making a little bit of a statement.”

So, Annie grabbed a sharpie and wrote the words “Latina contra Trump” (Latina against Trump) on a white t-shirt. She covered it with a sweater, then the pair headed off to the event at a local restaurant.

“I started getting nervous,” Annie admitted, “because everyone there was so excited and I thought, ‘Gosh, they’re going to get so angry if I protest this.”

While Eric Trump was speaking to the crowd, Annie cautiously removed her sweater — but no one seemed to notice her protest.

“I thought ‘contra’ was pretty clear, but I guess not,” she said.

At the end of his speech, a reporter asked if the sisters were going to try to line up for a photo with Trump.

“They have about four people looking every person up and down before you go and get a picture,” Ceci said, “so we thought there was no way we could get a photo with them.”

“I was sort of in disbelief when they actually called us forward,” Ceci said. “I was like, ‘This is not happening. There’s no way they don’t see this shirt.’”

But happen it did, and the sisters snapped this photo with the Trumps.

“I couldn’t wrap my brain around it,” Ceci said, “so I just stood there and smiled.”

“Right after, we ran out and looked at each other and just screamed,” she said.

The sisters then tweeted some photos, which soon went massively viral. Ceci’s post alone was shared tens of thousands of times.

When you protest a Trump rally but no one realizes your shirt says ""Latinas AGAINST trump"" so they take pics w/ you… https://t.co/ID6VpLGVDl

“There were a ton of positive reactions and people commending us for our bravery,” Ceci said, adding that they did have to block a few “negative people.”

No one at the rally realized my shirt said AGAINST tr*mp... congrats, y'all played yourselves ✌🏽️✌🏽️✌🏽️

“We weren’t protesting the fact that he’s a conservative or a Republican,” Annie said. “We were protesting their particular treatment of Hispanics and Latino immigrants in this country.”

“It’s been almost two years of Trump continuously putting down Latinos, making us feel like we don’t belong. So, my whole thing was to go there and say, ‘I’m Latina and we’re against you because of what you say about our race,’” Annie said.

“We were kind of in disbelief that no one understood this protest,” Ceci said. “It really goes to show the lack of diversity in their team.”","sister,trump,eric trump,anni,latina,contra,eric,protest,ceci,sister anni"

WASHINGTON ― The rate hikes are coming. Eight days before the beginning of a crucial enrollment season for the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchange marketplaces, federal officials announced Monday how much prices are going up. 
The gist: a lot. But like everything Obamacare, it’s not that simple. The law’s financial assistance will protect millions of lower-income families from these premium increases, and others can find relief by switching to different plans next year to save money. There will losers, however, mostly among higher-income households that find can’t avoid the premium increases and are forced to either pay more or go without health insurance. 
The average premium for the second-lowest-cost “silver” level plan on the exchanges ― the ones used to calculate tax credits eligible households can use to make coverage less expensive ― is increasing by 25 percent next year in the 39 states that use the federal system on HealthCare.gov, according to a Department of Health and Human Services report. The least-costly plans, on average, will range from $366 a month for “bronze” coverage to $674 a month for “platinum,” not counting subsidies. 
Health insurance companies across the country are levying higher prices ― sometimes, much higher ― for 2017 than they did during the first three years of the Obamacare exchanges. The average benchmark plan price rose 2 percent from 2014 to 2015, and 7 percent from 2015 to this year. HHS didn’t provide an estimate of the overall average premium increases for all plans sold on the federal exchanges.
President Barack Obama made a forceful case on Thursday that the Affordable Care Act has been a success, pointing to the 20 million previously uninsured people gaining coverage since 2014 and the uninsured rate, which has never been lower. Obama also trumpeted provisions of the law, such as the ban against health insurers rejecting customers with pre-existing conditions and the availability of preventive medical services without co-payments.
The health insurance exchanges, however, haven’t attained the stability insurers demand to earn a profit on their Obamacare business, leading big players like UnitedHealth Group and Aetna, along with some smaller, regional insurers, to scale back participation in these markets because of financial losses, and others to raise rates. 
The result, as the new HHS report makes clear, is that consumers will have fewer choices next year at the same time premiums are climbing. The total number of insurance providers available on the federal exchanges for next year is 167, a net decrease of 68. Likewise, the average number of insurance policies available in each county has declined from 47 to 30.
The average increase for the benchmark plans masks a tremendous amount of variation on what’s happening at the state level. According the the HHS report, a 27-year-old on average faces a 116 percent increase for an unsubsidized benchmark plan in Arizona, but that same person in Indiana would see a 2 percent price decrease. And the actual, unsubsidized dollar amounts vary greatly, from $760 a month in Alaska to $219 a month in New Hampshire.
The main problem with the exchanges so far is that those who enrolled proved to be sicker, and thus costlier, than insurers and regulators expected, and too few healthier customers signed up to offset those expenses with their premium dollars. This forced insurance companies to raise premiums to cover those costs. In addition, temporary programs from the Affordable Care Act that were designed to compensate insurers with sicker-than-average customers expire this year, so companies also are increasing rates to make up the difference.
Health care costs are rising across the nation, although more slowly than they used to. But the dynamics causing Obamacare premium increases aren’t affecting those who get coverage elsewhere, including from government programs like Medicaid and Medicare or from employers. Job-based insurance premiums have been going up at a lower-than-historical rate in recent years, and that trend is expected to continue in 2017.
Open enrollment on the health insurance exchanges begins Nov. 1 and runs through Jan. 31. The Department of Health and Human Services on Monday switched on a “window-shopping” feature on HealthCare.gov that allows consumers to review unsubsidized prices. 
“For consumers who currently have marketplace coverage or are uninsured, our advice is the same as it’s been: Go check out HealthCare.gov for yourself,” Kathryn Martin, HHS acting assistant secretary for planning and evaluation, told reporters on a conference call Monday. “Not only are you likely to find affordable options for quality coverage, but the odds are good you’ll find plans more affordable than the public debate about the ACA might lead you to expect.”
Eighty-four percent of the people who use the exchanges receive tax credits and thus will be protected, as least in part, from higher prices. That’s because the maximum premium for subsidy-eligible people is pegged to a percentage of their incomes, so the financial assistance will rise along with the premiums. 
The HHS report further shows that these consumers could actually spend 20 percent less per month than this year if they shop around and opt for the cheapest available plan in their current “metal” level for 2017, which would provide comparable coverage.
Tax credits are available to households earning between the federal poverty level and four times that income, or about $12,000 to $47,000 for a single person, and about $24,000 to $97,000 for a family of four. 
At the lower end of the income range ― and 81 percent of those on the federal exchanges earn 250 percent of the poverty level or less ― the subsidies are large. That’s why, despite the large rate increases for next year, HHS estimates that 77 percent of marketplace consumers could find coverage for $100 a month or less, and 65 percent could get plans that cost $50 a month or less.
Nevertheless, that still leaves millions of people who don’t qualify for tax credits on the exchanges, or who buy unsubsidized policies directly from a health insurance company or through a broker. 
Those households will bear the full brunt of these premium hikes. Some portion of them will decide they can’t afford the increase and will opt to be uninsured and pay the tax penalty for not having coverage, under the law’s individual mandate. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 9 million people get their insurance “off-exchange,” and HHS data show that 2.2 million people who enrolled on the exchanges this year didn’t receive subsidies.
Obama administration officials are describing 2017 as a “transition” year for the exchanges, because insurers now know enough about their customers’ costs to more accurately set prices. Officials predict large increases are less likely in the future. 
The Department of Health and Human Services projects 13.8 million people will choose a plan during the three-month sign-up campaign for 2017, which would be 1.1 million more than the tally during the 2016 open enrollment period. Average monthly paid enrollment will be 11.4 million next year, also 1.1 million higher than the same figure this year. 
This represents modest growth, despite the fact that tens of millions of people remain uninsured, and even though just under half of them would qualify for subsidies. HHS also estimates that 2.5 million subsidy-eligible people currently are paying full price because they aren’t using the exchanges and instead are buying directly from insurers off the exchanges.
But high sticker prices, especially for those who receive small subsidies or none at all, threaten to discourage people who need the coverage the least: those healthy individuals that insurers covet because they pay in and seldom draw down. If these exchanges can’t find the right balance between costs and revenues, insurers will be less willing to sell policies on them, and customers will be less willing to buy that coverage, which would undermine the system for everyone using it.
Obama has proposed a number of amendments to the Affordable Care Act, as has Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, including increasing the financial assistance available and creating a government-run public option plan that would compete with private insurers. 
Congressional Republicans oppose these changes to the law and maintain that the law must entirely be repealed, a position shared by GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. No Republican has proposed an alternative approach that would maintain current, historically high level of health insurance coverage.

d67fc267,http://www.therichest.com/shocking/15-celeb-couples-with-the-biggest-age-gap/,15 Celeb Couples With The Biggest Age Gap,"They say that love is blind and that Cupid’s arrow is most likely to hit you hardest when you least expect it. It is rarely convenient, but often worth it. When a couple falls in love, no one else in the world matters, because they have found their soul mate. A pairing that feels perfectly natural may not necessarily meet societal expectations of ideal coupling, but that doesn’t mean it won’t work out for those involved.

There’s a mathematical formula some people consider as a fairly accurate guideline in order to determine whether or not a significant age gap is going to be insurmountable for a couple. The formula is half the oldest person’s age, plus seven. But does a mathematical formula created by those with the purpose of putting societal constraints on people following their hearts really have a place within the world or modern romance? Especially since May/December romances have been around for almost as long as there have been calendars. Some of the most famous romance movies involve big age differences, think Harold and Maude, The Graduate,or How Stella Got Her Groove Back.

While there may be some debate and whispers about whom is dating who, what does it matter in the great scheme of things? Most of these 15 couples would smash any mathematical age related formulas, yet for the most part have managed long term relationships for a considerable length of time despite a hefty age difference. Wine and cheese get better with age. Why not lovers? Let’s count down 15 famous couples with big age gaps, from a whisper worthy 15 years difference to a shocking 60.

Ashton and Demi would “pass” the age math equation if they hooked up today, with a 15 year age gap, but when they met and began dating in 2003, Moore was 41 and Kutcher was 25. The two were married in 2005, and Ashton became a part of the family, alongside Demi Moore and Bruce Willis’s three daughters, Rumer, Scout and Tallulah. Unfortunately, in 2011 the couple split, and their divorce was finalized in 2013. Rumer Willis says she and Ashton (her previous stepdad) have tried to stay in touch, telling Access Hollywood, “It’s nice as I’ve gotten older, I realized the other day that he was a year younger than me [now] when he and my mom started going out, so that would be like me meeting someone who already had three teenage kids and kind of going into that whole situation was crazy.” Rumer then joked that a family reunion probably isn’t in the cards but teased, “It would be the best reality TV special ever.”

Ellen and Portia met through mutual friends in 2001, and it wasn’t love at first sight. A few years later, in 2004, Portia ran into Ellen at a photo shoot and the second time was a charm! The pair officially started dating in December 2004. In 2008, when the California Supreme Court overthrew the ban on same sex marriage the duo exchanged vows that same August, to a very intimate crowd of 19 friends and family members. The two do not have plans to have children, and enjoy each other’s company along with renovations and remodelling homes. An insider told People Magazine, “They both love to celebrate special occasions and holidays, and their wedding anniversary is no different. They usually celebrate with a big party and invite a lot of friends,” the insider says. “They really are a lovely couple. They enjoy being married, and it shows.” The couple have a 15 year age difference; Ellen is 58 years old, while Portia is 43 years old.

Sometimes a big age gap doesn’t work out, despite the duo seeming like a great pair. Sean Penn and Charlize Theron have a 15 year age gap between them, but were seen happily attending red carpet events arm in arm for over a year and a half. The two were even engaged. They began dating in 2013, after their decades of friendship blossomed into romance, and at one point Penn filed to adopt Charlize’s son. Following their break-up, a source close to Theron said, “Charlize was seeing that it was just too intense for her and she needed a breather. She still loves him and respects him to the fullest but she just needed to get out of his intense atmosphere. She is still very young at heart and he plays things by the book.” The two have managed to keep the breakup amicable, and have remained on very good terms.

While people who grew up in the 1980s may always see Mary-Kate Olsen as a perpetual toddler exclaiming, “You Got it Dude!” Mary-Kate is 29, and a bonafide adult, with a husband who is 45 years old, and 17 years her senior. Olivier Sarkozy is a banker and is half-brother of the former President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy. Their intimate wedding reception hosted only 50 guests, and favours included bowls of cigarettes, so guests could smoke the night away. The pair dated for three years before tying the knot, and Olivier proposed to Mary-Kate during a romantic vacation in Jamaica. Her engagement ring was a four-carat vintage Cartier ring. Mary-Kate didn’t accept Olivier’s first offer though. T he Jamaica engagement was reported to be the second time the banker got down on one knee for the actor, turned fashion mogul, but still best known as Full House’s Michelle Tanner.

It’s no secret that the Oscar Winning DiCaprio has his choice of leading ladies everywhere. Recently the environmental activist actor began dating Sports Illustratedmodel Nina Agdal, who is 17 years younger than him. The dapper DiCaprio is quite taken with young Nina, and was spotted at a restaurant in Soho during New York Fashion week. A witness said, “He and Nina were really cute, lots of women were around him, but he was only paying attention to her.” Sources recently told OK Magazinethat it isn’t all romance, and the model is tiring of her beau’s “frat boy friends” (including Lukas Haas and Jonah Hill). The source added that Nina feels she’s just being seen as a dumb model and, “She’ll try to start an interesting conversation when they’re around, but with the wolf pack it’s all sports talk and dumb jokes.” Time will only tell if this becomes a deal breaker for the 24 year old and 41 year old DiCaprio.

In a couple that defies both age and old school British classism, Jason Statham and Rosie Huntington make it work. She’s 28, and a model turned actress; he’s a 48 year old actor, from a working class family, and admittedly a little rough around the edges, but they’ve got this. While Huntington comes from a long line of aristocrats, and she had the luxury of having her career “find her”, Jason began training to be a part of the British diving team in the 1980s and went on to working on toning his body, while dabbling in fitness modelling. Despite having very different hobbies, ages, and upbringings this odd couple offers some secrets to their success. Jason says, “We get drunk and float around the swimming pool”, while she says, “We’re best mates. He makes me laugh every day. I almost feel like I never had a proper boyfriend before.”

They met on the set of the film Bugsyin 1991. At the time he was 54 and she was a spry 33. The 21 year age gap is the bare minimum for the age equation, and the two have been together for over 25 years now. Warren Beatty was once a legendary womanizer, having once said how he couldn’t sleep at night unless he’d had sex, having bedded nearly an estimated 13,000 women. He had been linked to Joan Collins, Madonna and Carly Simon (who it’s believed had written the song “You’re So Vain” about Beatty). The two had lunch before they began work together and Beatty apparently called the Bugsydirector later to declare his love for Bening, and that he was going to marry her. The couple married in 1992 and have four children together. Although Beatty had previously joked that those with a wife of 40 should be able to make a trade for two twenties, much like currency, the pair appear to be keeping it together.

They met at the Golden Globe Awards nearly 15 years ago, but we know that Calista shot first in pursuing her Han Solo. She intentionally spilled her drink on Ford in hopes of securing some face time with the star, who is 22 years older than her. The two were dating for two years before Harrison Ford officially divorced his screenwriter ex-wife, Melissa Matheson, although the former couple had been separated for over a year before he met Flockhart. Harrison has said of his relationship, “I was 60 when I fell in love with Calista, what surprised me most was that I was still capable of establishing a long-lasting relationship, making a serious commitment. With my children, in my private life or my work, I try to learn from my mistakes and evolve.”

The pair were eventually wed at the New Mexico Governor’s mansion after eight years together as a couple. It was an intimate affair with a very select guest list, even Ford’s four grown children didn’t make the guest list. His son Ben joked with Peoplemagazine, “Those crazy kids went off and eloped! I’m so happy for them.” Today the couple can be seen out and about at sporting events, still enjoying each other’s company.

This list wouldn’t be complete without a mention of the 24 year age difference between presidential candidate Donald Trump and his wife Melania. Melania is a jewelry and watch designer, and former model, and Trump’s third wife. Melania met “The Donald” at a party in New York City during fashion week in 1998. Although Melania was reluctant to give Donald her phone number initially, the two began dating for a short period of time before Melania broke it off. The two reconciled a few months later, were engaged in 2004, and married in Palm Beach Florida in 2005. Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton were guests at the couple’s wedding. In 2006 Melania gave birth to their son Barron William Trump. Barron reportedly has his own floor in the Trumps’ apartment in Trump Tower, Manhattan, enjoys wearing a suit, plays golf with his father, and his mother’s nickname for him is “Mini-Donald.”

They’ve had their series of ups and downs as a couple, because who hasn’t? However, through it all they’ve maintained a strong relationship together. They have worked through Douglas’s 2010 diagnosis with stage four mouth cancer, and Zeta-Jones facing her diagnosis of bipolar disorder. The pair met at a film festival in 1998, and were married in 2000. Today Douglas is 72 and Zeta-Jones is 47, with a 25 year age difference between them. They have two children, Dylan (16), and Carys (13). In speaking with the Daily Mirror about his wife, and their marriage, the actor said, “Catherine was extraordinary. She really took hold of the issue in a way, with due respect, that is not always true of the Brits.” He added, “In the end we were able to see the big picture and move on. Now, we’re closer than ever.” Michael has also said that surviving cancer has helped him learn to live in the moment.

Sarah Paulson is best known for her role on the hit series, American Horror Story,however more recently she’s been known for her May-December Romance to Holland Taylor. Paulson is 41 years old, and she is dating Holland Taylor, known for her work on The L Wordand The Truman Show.The two actors met at a dinner party over a decade ago, but Paulson was in another relationship at the time. In speaking about her choices and relationship Paulson has said, “If my life choices had to be predicated based on what was expected of me from a community on either side, that’s going to make me feel really straitjacketed, and I don’t want to feel that,” Paulson told the newspaper of her partner, 32 years her senior, “What I can say absolutely is that I am in love, and that person happens to be Holland Taylor.”

This big age difference has a definite ick factor to it that made headlines, since after all he was pretty much her stepfather. Soon Yi Previn was the daughter of Woody’s girlfriend Mia Farrow (Soon Yi was adopted by Farrow). Farrow decided to separate from Allen in 1992 when she discovered naked photos of her daughter that had been taken by the director. There are 35 years between the two, who began a relationship and were married in 1997. They adopted two daughters, one in 1999, and one in 2000. The two remain a couple today, celebrating nearly 25 years together. Despite the controversy, and allegations from another adopted daughter surrounding sexual assault, Woody Allen has still enjoyed a successful career. When Allen was asked how his relationship with Soon Yi has changed him by The Hollywood Reporter, he said, “Changed me? I don’t know if you could say she changed me… I might be the same person I was when I was 20.”

There is nothing new about workplace romances, even if the business is music, fame, and fortune. Trailblazer rocker Steven Tyler, lead singer of Aerosmith, found romance with his assistant, Aimee Ann Preston, who is 39 years younger than him. She is 28, and he is 68 (Tyler’s daughter Liv is 39, and daughter Mia is 37 years old). The two have kept a fairly low profile, but were seen holding hands at the Elton John AIDS Foundation Viewing Party in February 2016. This was their official “public debut” as a couple. They were first suspected of being a couple in 2014, when they were seen together on a vacation in Maui. Aimee was previously an assistant in the Trump Organization (yeah that Trump) and began working for Tyler in 2012. The couple moved in together in March 2016. A source close to Tyler has said, “People are always wondering and now it’s kind of finally out in the open. I think at some point, because she is always with him and does live with him, it’s like ‘OK, it’s more than just a personal assistant.’ They’re out together all the time. She doesn’t leave his side.”

Rock and Roll is known for its youth, with many aging rockers priding themselves on their vigour, despite being long in the tooth. The co-founder of The Rolling Stones is no different. Mick Jagger was 70 when he met Melanie Hamrick, when they began dating in 2014. The young ballerina was a spry 27 years young when they began their relationship. In the summer of 2016, a spokesperson confirmed that Melanie Hamrick was expecting, with the couple’s child due to arrive in January 2017. The pair are rocking a 43 year age gap, and this will be the eighth child for Sir Mick Jagger (the other seven children are from past relationships). A spokesperson has said of Melanie, and the imminent arrival of their little one, “She knows what a great relationship Mick has with all of his children and can’t wait for him to be a dad again. They are taking the news in their stride.”

Legendary Playboy Hugh Hefner has been slaying the ladies for decades and released the first ever issue of Playboymagazine in 1953 with cover model Marilyn Monroe. The world famous ladies’ man has been married three times (so far) in his 90 plus years. Most recently he got hitched to model Crystal Harris who is 60 years younger than him. He and Harris started dating in 2008, were engaged in 2011, and have been married to each other since 2012, holding the ceremony at the infamous Playboy Mansion. Hefner has four children (all from previous relationships) with his youngest child born in 1991, and five years younger than Step-Mother Crystal.","coupl,relationship,ag,ag differ,pair,romanc,ag gap,15 coupl,gap,daughter"

Miley Cyrus bent over and flashed her crotch for a cause on Oct. 23, telling fans to ‘kiss her a**’ if they don’t vote for Hillary Clinton. This comes shortly after she campaigned for the Democratic candidate! See the racy pic here!

It’s safe to say Miley Cyrus, 23, is going the extra mile when encouraging fans to vote for Hillary Clinton, 68, as the next President of the United States. The “Cant Be Tamed” songstress decided to show off her flexibility in a very compromising pose on Oct. 23, flashing her crotch while fighting for a cause. She captioned the risque pic of her posing in yogi pants and a sports top, “Kiss my ashtanga ass if you aren’t voting for @hillaryclinton #mydreamistodoyogawithHC.” Miley hasn’t been shy in the least about her unwavering support for the Democratic candidate, proving it very much with the hashtag, “I’mwithher.” She certainly knows how to leave a lasting impression!

It’s only been one day since Miley gave students the shock of their lives by stopping by George Mason University’s campus in Virginia while she campaigned for Hillary. Rocking a sparkling blue crop top and striped skirt, she showed off her patriotism while connecting with millennials ahead of Nov. 8 election. She made sure to hit all the political hot-topics, like LGBTQ rights and of course, Hillary’s chic white pantsuit at the third presidential debate. She even bashed Republican candidate, Donald Trump, 70, also letting everyone know that she supports Planned Parenthood.

Miley has been super busy lately, especially with her stint on the Voice, but that didn’t stop her from taking time out of her hectic schedule to stand up for what she felt was right. As far as her future on the hit NBC singing competition, it’s still questionable as to whether or not the iconic pop star will be making her return the next time around. As we previously reported, “The ratings for S 11 have been great and everyone loves . However, is and has not made any decisions yet.” Looks like she’s been keeping proactive anyways!

HollywoodLifers, are YOU shocked by Miley’s latest pic or not in the least? Let us know!",

The crowned winner of Miss Anambra 2015 competition, Chidinma Okeke, is currently embroiled in a lesbian sex tape scandal. The video which looks very recent shows the queen who is from Orumba North (or maybe someone that looks like her as she claimed) engaged in lesbian acts with one of her close friends, a lady known as ‘Ada’.

Ada is said to be a beauty queen too and also doubles as Chidinma’s personal assistant. Ada is said to be the 3rd runner up of the Queen of Democracy 2014. In the weird, degrading video, Chidinma was seen fondling with her vagina and later using cucumber on it before the said Ada came over to caress and smooch her. All these were done in a dingy room, with the bed on the floor and hair net on ‘Queen Chidinma’.

The video started out with Chidinma fondling her vagina
After the cucumber session, her partner Ada, came over
After the video had been trending online for a while, Chidinma came out to deny she is the one in the video. She insists it was photoshopped and her face was super-imposed into the existing pictures. She wrote:
”My attention has been drawn to a concocted photograph/ video being circulated in the social media wherein my face was superimposed on an existing picture of persons engaging amorous conduct through the art of photo shopping.This act is perpetrated by hodlums who are out to blackmail me or tarnish my image and promising career by presenting me in bad light. I wish to say that the said image is certainly not mine by any stretch of imagination.
”I am a highly responsible person who was brought up in a family with impeccable reputation. I can therefore not subscribe to such act how much more engage in same . Meanwhile I have referred the matter to my lawyer for possible prosecution of the culprits and civil claim. Please be advised to discountenance the said photograph/ video and regard it as handiworks of detractors. Thank you.
Okeke Chidinma”
But her followers on Instagram aren’t buying her denial. They lambasted her for having that ridiculous and demeaning sexual act taped on a camera and coming out to lie about it again, as it is so glaring she is the one in the video. See reactions below:

Suman Das, 46, was arrested at Manchester Airport after the 18-year old victim claimed he touched her between her legs as she was dozing in her seat.
Suman Das leaving Manchester Magistrates’ Court with his wife Sonia after being convicted of sexually assaulting a teenage girl as he sat next to his wife on the passenger flight to the UK
Qatari Das initially claimed he must have touched her by accident whilst fidgeting in his seat and offered to apologise – but he later said he could not have carried out an assault as he was asleep.
The victim said she woke up to feel a ‘rubbing sensation’ and fled to the back of the plane in tears.
At the time of the assault Das’ wife Sonia was sat beside him unaware of her husband’s behaviour.
Das, who has been staying with friends in Bolton since his arrest, was convicted of sexual assault after a trial at Manchester magistrates court . He had denied the charge.
The incident occurred in July five hours into the flight from Doha to Manchester on Qatar Airways.
Das and his wife were visiting the UK for a ”holiday of a lifetime” as the girl returned to Britain after spending two months travelling in Thailand.
The victim told the hearing: “He knew exactly what he was doing and he wasn’t sleeping. He was looking at me, I saw he was looking at me.
“He must have been looking at me to see if I was awake. He did move very quickly once he saw that I was awake.”
In a statement Das said later: “I may have touched accidentally – but I didn’t touch her intentionally.”
Suman Das initially claimed he must have touched her by accident whilst fidgeting in his seat and offered to apologise – but he later said he could not have carried out an assault as he was asleep
Prosecuting Holly Holden said: “In this case the victim has zero motivation to make a false claim. Her evidence has been consistent and credible throughout. This was an 18-year-old flying alone. She said that the defendant touched her between the legs over her clothing.
“One person sitting next to another may jostle someone with their elbow but to touch them between the legs without knowing is a deliberate action. He gave two versions of events and said he was very concerned that this could prevent him from getting a UK visa and would destroy his life.”
During the hearing Das’ wife of 23 years said she had ‘complete faith in her husband’ and added: “I have had no concern. Until today I have faith in my husband and still today I have total faith in my husband.”
She also told the court that Das told her following the flight that if he saw the girl and her mother he wanted to talk to them to apologise.
Das’ lawyer Miss Ellie Akhgar told JPs: ”This man has no previous convictions, so why would he now decide to take the plunge into criminality and sexually assault a stranger on a plane, with his wife sat next to him.
”He is a family man and a visitor to this country and has been here for the last three months.
”Being awoken by the ‘sensation’ of sexual assault does not mean a sexual assault took place. The whole time she says nothing. This was a very very long flights and this man is being scrutinised for fidgeting.
”It is easy for a man of his age and his culture to apologise – he wanted to calm the waves in a turbulent sea of confusion. He apologised because he wants to fix what it is he has done wrong. This is a case of a very serious misunderstanding. Very serious misunderstandings can happen.”
Das was granted conditional bail pending sentence on October 27.

(The Kremlin and the Bolshoy Kamenny Bridge in Moscow. Photo Credit: Wikipedia)
The US and Russia have been exchanging tirades and reportedly deploying their people in respective “hot” areas. Now, there are talks that Kremlin is set to carry out an attack in two weeks. Will a “global war” ensue because of this US Russia War?
It is said the Vladimir Putin has positioned Russian warships to cruise near the North sea, passing merely a mile from British shores in the English Channel while en route to the Mediterranean to intensify administration in Syria. At the same time, there are reports that the US is using a cave system in Norway to prepare artillery and military gear good for 15,000.
US Russia War: What is Kremlin planning?
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) advised that the naval force will be a component of Russia’s intention to conclude the Civil War in Syria and “declare victory” for Putin and Bashar al-Assad.
Russia and the US are both supporting clashing sides in the civil war—with Russia backing up Assad, while the US is for the rebel fighters seeking out to put an end to his relentless government. The US has held Putin responsible for “war crimes”, which has significantly impacted the two nations’ relationship with each other.
The possibility of a total war is becoming a source of alarm for the public, as Russia has been reportedly preparing their nation for war, with Kremlin hosting nuclear attack drills for as many as 40 million people.
“They are deploying all of the Northern fleet and much of the Baltic fleet in the largest surface deployment since the end of the Cold War,” a senior diplomat said. “This is not a friendly port call. In two weeks, we will see a crescendo of air attacks on Aleppo as part of Russia’s strategy to declare victory there.” he added.

US Getting Battle Ready?
At the same time, a new report reveals that US tanks and artillery are hidden in a cave system at the border of Russia. A lot of materials are said to be currently stashed in a climate-controlled cave as tensions continue to rise between the rival states.
The caves, which are Cold War relics, are packed with new equipment to be tapped when necessary. Central Norway is said to have six secret tunnels throughout its land as the nation shares a 122 mile-long border with Russia.
Putin warns the West
Vladimir Putin has urged the West not to “provoke Russia’s fury”, with generals saying that the Russian president has declared: “if they want a war, they will have a war”. US forces have arranged to send the Marines to Norway, to reinforce the NATO frontier with the Motherland.
With the current incidents, sources are noting that “tensions have reached a limit” similar to that of the Cold War period.
Now, as the US claims Russia’s involement with “war crimes,” Putin alleges that the “Americans lied” about the position of their missiles. The source also adds that the US situation said weapons in Turkey to Romania in early 2016, because of “frequent threats” from Iran.

Look for the US Media to COMPLETELY ignore this story!
The latest release reveals current DNC chair Donna Brazile, when working as a DNC vice chair, forwarded to the Clinton campaign a January 2016 email obtained from the Bernie Sanders campaign, released by Sarah Ford, Sanders’ deputy national press secretary, announcing a Twitter storm from Sanders’ African-American outreach team. “FYI” Brazile wrote to the Clinton staff. “Thank you for the heads up on this Donna,” replied Clinton campaign spokesperson Adrienne Elrod.
The second batch of emails include more evidence of collusion between the mainstream media and Clinton Campaign.
One email, received by prolific Clinton donor Haim Saban, was forwarded to Clinton staff, praising the friendly moderators in the early March 2016 Democratic primary debate co-hosted by Univision in Florida. “Haim, I just wanted to tell you that I thought the moderators for last nights Debate were excellent. They were thoughtful, tough and incisive. I thought it made Hilary appear direct and strong in her resolve. I felt it advanced our candidate. Thanks for Univision,” wrote Rob Friedman, former co-chair of the Motion Picture Group.
Another email discusses planting a favorable Clinton story in The New York Times in March 2015. “NYT heroine. Should she call her today?” Podesta wrote to other Clinton campaign staffers with the subject line ‘Laura Donohoe.’ “I do think it’s a great idea! We can make it happen,” replied Huma Abedin. The story they referred to is likely “In New Hampshire, Clinton Backers Buckle Up,” published in The New York Times on March 12, 2015 about Laura Donahoe, a retired nurse and Clinton supporter in New Hampshire.

Brad Pitt is finding himself lonely now that he’s not around Angelina Jolie and their six kids, and after over a decade with Angie a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that he has very few friends left to turn to. Here’s the scoop.
“Brad (Pitt) has really lost almost all his friends during his time with Angie (Jolie),” a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Unfortunately, Brad went over a decade without reaching out to his buddies because Angie didn’t want to spend time with them. “She was a loner who didn’t really like to socialize with his group of friends.”
So why didn’t Brad just go hang out with his friends alone? “Brad was totally infatuated with Angie from the get-go and would do whatever she asked,” the insider explained. “She really wasn’t into hanging out with his friends so Brad followed her lead and lost touch with many of them.” So sad!
Luckily it seems like many of his friends are still more than willing to work on their relationship with him. “I really hope that he reaches back out because there are a lot of us who haven’t seen him in 10 years, and it was hard then,” revealed Melissa Etheridge in an Oct. 4 talk with Andy Cohen for his SiriusXM show. “We all lost a friend.”
Plus, it seems like Brad will always have his bestie George Clooney by his side. HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY learned that George has been giving Brad advice since he heard the news, and that he was actually urging him to reconcile with Angie. Thank god Brad still has someone to turn to in the toughest times.

“There was trouble lurking out there,” said John Clark.  “We had no idea how bad it is,” he added. The energy executive was hesitant about sharing his story due to his daughter’s ongoing trauma.

Today the U.S. arsenal stands at around 4,500 warheads, including both deployed and stored weapons. Critics of the U.S. current posture say that the United States could safely reduce its arsenal of deployed strategic nuclear weapons by an additional third from New START levels. They also say that the U.S. strategic and tactical “hedge” — weapons kept in reserve as technical and strategic backups – could be reduced as well.
Over the last twenty-five years, Russian and U.S. nuclear weapons stockpiles have decreased dramatically, thanks in part to the efforts of leaders who recognized the risks of nuclear war.
Today the U.S. arsenal stands at around 4,500 warheads, including both deployed and stored weapons. According to the military’s own analysis, the arsenal could still be significantly reduced without compromising deterrence.
The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) says that President Obama can and should order these and other reductions immediately. “Past presidents have made similar cuts without involving Congress and without guarantees from Russia; President Obama should do the same.”
What to cut
In 2013, a comprehensive government review found that the United States could safely reduce its arsenal of deployed strategic nuclear weapons by an additional third from New START levels, even if Russia does not make further reductions (New START is a 2010 arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russia).
UCS argues that such a step still makes sense for the United States. The levels outlined by the administration are more than adequate for deterring a nuclear attack, and would cost significantly less to maintain than the current outsized arsenal.
In addition to deployed weapons, the administration could also cut the “hedge” — weapons kept in reserve as technical and strategic backups. UCS analysis found that the United States could immediately reduce the strategic hedge by at least 1,000 weapons, leaving 1,250 strategic weapons. In addition, the United States could eliminate the tactical hedge of 300 weapons.
Too much plutonium is not a good thing
UCS also argues that U.S. military stockpiles of plutonium and highly enriched uranium are much larger than necessary, expensive to store safely, and pose serious security risks.
Depending on cuts made to the arsenal, the United States could safely dispose of between 18 and 22 metric tons of plutonium (in addition to plutonium currently declared as excess), while still retaining enough for existing warheads.
Similarly, the United States could dispose of an additional 140 to 185 metric tons of highly enriched uranium without impacting the current arsenal.

33413ec0,http://www.nationalreview.com/article/441379/service-employees-international-union-ballot-initiative-1501-freedom-foundation-public-records-act,"In Washington State, Unions Advance a Ballot Measure to Keep Members in the Dark","On November 8, voters across the state of Washington will decide Ballot Initiative 1501, the Seniors and Vulnerable Individuals’ Safety and Financial Crimes Prevention Act. If passed, the measure’s proponents claim, I-1501 will increase criminal penalties for targeting seniors and vulnerable individuals in acts of identity theft and consumer fraud and will prohibit the release of any public records that may facilitate such crimes. But it would accomplish neither objective. The measure’s sole sponsor, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), is brazenly attempting to deceive voters and misuse the statewide initiative process.
To look into the facts is to discover that I-1501’s intent has nothing to do with protecting citizens, and everything to do with altering the Public Records Act to prevent the Freedom Foundation, a conservative think tank, from obtaining the membership list of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) — and, specifically, from obtaining the names of members who serve as home care providers and informing them of their constitutional right to opt out of paying union fees.
In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state-employed care providers have the option of leaving unions such as the SEIU, and since then, the Freedom Foundation has aggressively taken action. Its strategy is to file public records requests, obtain union membership lists, and contact every member, even if it has to go door to door, to inform those who have been left in the dark that they can stop paying into the union. “A lot of people didn’t even know they were in the union, or that they were having the dues being deducted from their Medicaid reimbursement checks,” Brian Minnich, the executive vice president of the Freedom Foundation, tells National Review.
The Freedom Foundation effortlessly obtained SEIU 925’s membership list through the Public Record Act and notified members of their rights. The union shrunk nearly 60 percent. In the courts, Washington’s other SEIU chapter, SEIU 775, challenged the Freedom Foundation’s use of public records, and the Freedom Foundation prevailed. The state supreme court refused to hear the union’s appeal. In the aftermath of its legal loss, SEIU has donated $1.6 million to fund I-1501 public advocacy in a final attempt to prevent the think tank from obtaining its membership list. The authors of I-1501 don’t explicitly state its true purpose, though. They have disguised the initiative with the spin that it protects seniors and vulnerable individuals from identity theft.
This notion that I-1501 would impede identity theft by prohibiting the release of public records is ludicrous. The state’s Public Records Act does not allow individuals to request sensitive information, and, as Minnich notes, the lists in question show only a member’s name and date of birth. “I-1501 is a Trojan horse,” as the Seattle Times editorial board perfectly describes the initiative and the SEIU’s attempt to deceive voters. Identity theft is a hot topic, and few people would oppose what seems to be an effort to close significant loopholes that identity thieves could exploit.
The SEIU has fully funded the campaign for I-1501, but it’s not just the powerful union that has deceived voters. The state’s attorney general has a responsibility to validate the title of each initiative, and clearly I-1501’s title does not represent that it would alter the Public Records Act. “The whole thing is just insidious,” Minnich says. “How in the world could you come up with a ballot title like that?”
If I-1501 passes, one effect will be that individuals will have less access to government records. Another noteworthy demand that the initiative stipulates is that within 180 days the department of social and health services will be required to “report to the governor and attorney general about any additional records that should be made exempt from public disclosure.” In other words, I-1501 would continue to erode the Public Records Act after it was implemented.
Regardless of the outcome on November 8, the Freedom Foundation will continue to challenge SEIU and other unions by contacting their members. In just one month, SEIU 775 lost 1,600 dues-paying members because of the Freedom Foundation’s activism and message, which has clearly resonated.
Ballot Initiative 1501 is a sham that, if passed, will allow the SEIU to chip away at the Public Records Act for the sake of keeping members uninformed about their constitutional rights. On November 8, Washington State voters should read past I-1501’s reassuring title, which is a Trojan horse.

2ae34c0f,https://www.buzzfeed.com/fvg/5-things-we-know-about-women-and-porn-and-1-impor-2mic4,5 Things We Know About Women And Porn (and 1 Important Thing We Don’t)," ‘Women’ do not have a single response to pornography 
Pornhub’s most recent statistics say that women account for 1 of every 3 visitors to Pornhub, and give a detailed breakdown of women’s behaviour on the site. But all women do not think about porn in the same way, nor have they had the same - or even similar - experiences. Two of the biggest studies particularly examining women’s views and use of pornography (one in the UK and one in Canada) found that there was no single attitude, pathway, or experience of pornography that could be classified as ‘women’s’. Instead of seeking to find the way that women respond to pornography, it is more useful to think through what is the same and what is different amongst women’s responses.
 2. Women have a range of relationships to porn 
Just as there is no one response to porn for women, there is no one relationship. Some women have tested out pornography alone, with friends or with sexual partners. Some start and stop their use at different stages, and for different reasons. We know very little about women who have never used pornography (porn refusers) and recent research in the U.S. has suggested women may be adversely impacted by the porn use of previous male sexual partners, but not affected by the use of current partners. Women’s relationships to porn are not stuck. They move between positions and may sometimes hold positions that appear contradictory.
 3. Most women who use feminist or alternative pornographies also use mainstream porn 
Though most research and thinking about women and pornography focuses on alternative pornographies, drawing a hard line between this and mainstream porn is more complicated in practice. A study on feminist pornography consumption among women conducted in 2015, found approximately 90% of the sample used mainstream porn alongside feminist pornography. We need to know more about women’s access of and exposure to mainstream online pornography, rather than only focusing on the possibilities present in alternative representations.
 4. Women can feel ambivalent about porn 
A study of working class women and pornography use in 2006, found that participants held distinctly ambivalent attitudes toward pornography. On one hand, most of the women enjoyed and valued porn films for entertainment, sexual arousal, and sexual education. On the other, they experienced occasional feelings of
contradiction and discomfort, arising from being uncertain about the well-being of the women in porn and/or their own personal experiences with sexual violence.
 5. The range of women’s views about pornography is rarely public 
Feminist debates on pornography (often divided into ‘pro-porn & anti-porn positions’) have obscured access to the range of views, practices, and experiences of pornography amongst women. Little research has been done asking women directly about pornography, including their reasons for using or not using online porn, and the range of experiences and opinions they may have in between.

464c9864,http://www.australianetworknews.com/britney-spears-wardrobe-malfunction-exposes-breasts-watch/,Britney Spears Wardrobe Malfunction Exposes Breasts? [WATCH],"Britney Spears nearly surprised everyone including herself at her recent Las Vegas live show.
She made her epic comeback on the stage of the recent MTV VMA 2016 awards. She gave a fiery performance of her latest hit Make Me alongside G-Eazy. The singer did her best to follow up the Lemonade performance of Beyoncé. Therefore, despite of what others had to say, it was still better than her disastrous 2007 appearance.
Her earlier performance at the Billboard Music Awards proved equally impressive. As this year’s recipient of the Billboard Millennium Award, Britney surprised everyone when she performed her greatest hits throughout her 20 years as a pop superstar.
Yet her latest performance proved to be the ultimate test for her return to the stage. Britney was in the middle of her show at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino when a wardrobe malfunction struck. Her first residency show at The Axis called Piece of Me would have literally given the audience a piece of her left boob for show.
Apparently, the clasp of her wardrobe came undone and caused her top to fall down. The numerous attempts of her dancers to help fasten it did not help. Fortunately, one of them gave up his flannel shirt to cover up the singer. Through it all, Britney did not stop singing, thus proving how much of a trooper she is.
Gossip Cop revealed this was not the first wardrobe malfunction of the singer during her show. At the end of her song 3, the singer wound up showing the audience a piece of her backside when the zipper of her leotard broke, hence an interesting name for her first Las Vegas residency show.

Viral2Trend reports that Boyati Miskun hung herself in the stairway of her employer’s building. Her suicide was allegedly brought about by the debts incurred from her sending $49,000 to internet scammers abroad. 
In 2011, Boyati met David Mark online, a man who claimed to be a U.S. Amy veteran living in Ghana. Nearly four years of correspondence transpired before Mark told Boyati he was going to retire and move to Indonesia to be with her. However, Mark told Boyati that he had $75,000 of gold stored Ghana. He put the ""gold certificate"" in Boyati’s name, claiming it would soon be sent to her in Indonesia. 
Boyati then received an email from Captain Samuel Friday asking her to send close to $50,000 to pay a customs clearance tax in order to retrieve the gold. Boyati did pay, but Friday alerted her afterward that she hadn’t paid on time. Then she began receiving death threats. 
According to Romance Scam, Boyati went to the Indonesian consulate for help, but officials there explained to her that she was scammed. 
“She got angry when I said Mark is part of the scammers, and that it was impossible for anybody to send 75 kilos of gold to someone he only knew [from the] Internet,” said Indonesian Vice Consul Rafail Walangitan. “She also refused to change her phone number, email, and Facebook to ‘break up’ with Mark,” said Rafail. 
Boyati refused to believe that Mark was in on the scam, eventually hanging herself out of despair.

cdea7075,http://www.aviationpros.com/press_release/12271191/scorpion-jet-successfully-completes-first-weapons-capability-exercise,Scorpion jet successfully completes first weapons capability exercise,"WICHITA, Kan. (Oct. 19, 2016) – Textron AirLand, LLC, a Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) company, today announced that the Scorpion jet has successfully completed its first weapons exercise at White Sands Missile Range, while operating from Holloman Air Force Base (HAFB) in New Mexico. This exercise effectively demonstrated the Scorpion’s close air support mission capability through the successful deployment of three widely used weapon systems.
The weapons system design, integration and flight test coordination for all three weapon types were achieved in an impressive time span of less than three months. The weapons testing program occurred Oct. 10-14 in coordination with the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) organization and the 586th Flight Test Squadron from HAFB. All weapon types performed flawlessly and included Hydra-70 unguided 2.75-inch rockets, BAE Systems’ Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) and AGM-114F Hellfire Missiles. The weapons were guided to their targets using first a ground-based laser designator system and then an airborne laser on the Scorpion‘s L-3 WESCAM’s MX-15Di sensor suite.
“The success of the first weapons capability exercise is a major milestone for the Scorpion program as we continue to demonstrate its mission flexibility and multi-role capabilities,” said Tom Hammoor, senior vice president of Defense at Textron Aviation. “We could not be more pleased with the results of this exercise, thanks to the collaboration between our Scorpion team, the NAVSEA organization and the Holloman Air Force Base.” 
The first Scorpion prototype continues its robust flight test program, while the first flight of the first production conforming Scorpion is expected soon.

It's one of the prettiest, easiest accessories to wear with your wedding dress, since it can stand alone as the sole accessory. It seems like you, our dear readers, can't get enough of them either, because we've seen so many gorgeous brides wearing them. And this is another reason flower crowns are so perfect for you: the possibilities are endless. Once reserved for bohemian brides, there's now one for everyone.
To find one that's quintessentially you, consider two factors: your personal style and the climate of your wedding. If you're more of an ethereal, Marchesa type of bride getting married in the spring, try a wreath of tiny white flowers, maybe intertwined with small pearls — so subtle and delicate.
Those getting married in a tropical climate might want to consider a punchy crown; one in an array of bright, bold colors. (Then, tie it all together with a lipstick color that matches one of the flowers in your crown — perhaps a pop of red or pink.)
Even winter brides can wear flower crowns: a wreath with acorns and greenery paired with cashmere wraps and fur muffs will look so chic. (A sprinkling of snow on your head also adds the perfect touch — check out slide four if you don't believe us.)
And one last thing: you don't have to choose between a flower crown and a veil. They work so beautifully together! Try our real bride's look in slide two and secure your veil into the back of the flower crown. Not only will it give your veil extra staying power, but will help it ever-so-softly breeze down the aisle.

Fashion fans were surprised to see that the models' knees had been erased on the publication's November cover.
""omfg that Gigi and kendall shoot who did their photoshop they need to be fired,"" one person tweeted in response.
""Why is photoshop like that allowed? Gigi and Kendall are beautiful the way they are,"" another added.
Others pointed out that the gaps in Jenner's smile had been removed, leaving the 20-year-old with one big tooth. 
Hadid's foot had also been altered in a way that made her -- six -- toes look melded together.
""The images of Kendall and Gigi are part of a project by artists Lizzie Fitch and Ryan Trecartin, who are known for their deliberate use of digital technology, combining distortions with makeup and prosthetics,"" a ""W"" spokesperson told BuzzFeed.
Jenner opened up about her career in an accompanying interview released this week. The model, who has walked the runway for Chanel and Balmain, told ""W"" she spends ""ten months out of the year"" working.
""I was, like, ten when I started thinking models were the coolest people in the world,"" she revealed. 
""My favorite model when I was ten was Gisele [Bundchen]. I didn't really know what I was talking about, and I think it's the only name I knew.""
""I'm working almost every day,"" the star said. ""I think I was raised to be a workaholic, so I think that I knew it was going to happen at some point. I've been working since I was ten years old.""

Clintons are so corrupt, everything they touch 'turns to molten lead'","Pithy former federal prosecutor Joe diGenova believes the recent Project Veritas video by James O’Keefe featuring DNC contractors explaining their dirty practices to foment violence at Trump events, is a prima facie case of federal and state criminal activity.
DiGenova says prosecutors should investigate everyone in the video, including Illinois Democrat Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky’s husband, Bob Creamer, who suddenly retired last week.
In this exclusive 26-minute video interview for The Daily Caller News Foundation, diGenova explains why many former and current FBI officials believe James Comey, the director of the FBI, is a “dirty cop.” When Comey refused to recommend prosecution of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her misuse of classified government information in July after “a fake and sophomoric” investigation, he bred cynicism and tainted the premier law enforcement agency.
When Republican nominee Donald Trump responds to calls from citizens to “lock her up,” the former prosecutor believes President Barack Obama’s Department of Justice “created a double standard for justice – one for the Clintons and one for the little guy.”
DiGenova suggests that the Republican Congress pass a “resolution of no confidence” on the FBI director as soon as they return to Washington after the election to demonstrate the significance of Comey’s corrosive, political decision.
DiGenova first laughs when asked about the charges by Democrats that the Russians are influencing American elections. He says, “the notion that the Russians are influencing this election is ludicrous. [Julian] Assange is a vessel. What’s the big deal? Nobody thought Daniel Ellsberg [who stole classified documents in 1971] was such a great guy because he stole the Pentagon Papers and gave them to the New York Times.”
He adds, if America’s system is so porous and vulnerable, we should “man up and get a better system.”
DiGenova discusses five takeaways from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s emails released by Wikileaks.
In general, the emails show an ugly, deceitful picture of how America’s foreign policy was run and that the Clintons only care about themselves.
He says, “everything the Clintons touch, they corrupt. Instead of the ‘golden touch,’ they have the ‘lead touch.’ Whatever they touch turns to molten lead — disgusting, creaky, foul-smelling molten lead.”
He discusses how people looking for government assistance never had to pay a secretary of state’s foundation to get a meeting until Secretary Clinton’s tenure. Speaking fees to Bill Clinton from companies such as telecom company, Ericsson, resulted in positive policy decisions.
“You give, you get. You give, you get. And, if you don’t give, you don’t get,” diGenova says in this video. It was “the single most corrupt Department of State in the history of the country.”
DiGenova compared the prosecution of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell — a Republican — to Hillary Clinton who, he says, was went unprosecuted, yet endangered American lives and operations. The lawyer suggests Hillary Clinton’s epithet on her tombstone might well be “She got away with it.”
He discusses how the emails uncovered media collusion, the commissioning of a good governance report by Chelsea Clinton, and the refusal to engage in any ethical discussion of contributions from the U.S. agents of foreign corporations or countries in order to “just take the money!”
He also mentions the abuse of the Haitians by the Clintons scrounging for charitable donations for favoritism in contracting there. DiGenova says, “people are dying in Haiti and the Clintons are dining out on the money from donors.”
DiGenova ends by asking, “Why shouldn’t the American people be worried about the legitimacy of an election when one of the highest law enforcement officials in the country, James Comey, the Director of the FBI, goes in public and lies about the reasons for what he did (in refusing to prosecute Hillary Clinton). The biggest single contributor to cynicism about this election is James Comey.”

In a decision that is being celebrated for its marked difference from recent sentences doled out for rape a judge in Fresno California sentenced a father to 1,503 years in prison for the repeated rape of his 14-year-old daughter. The man had been found guilty of raping his daughter numerous times over a four-year period.
On Friday Fresno prosecutor Nicole Galstan asked Judge Edward Sarkisian Jr. to pass the sentence of 1,503 years to a father who had raped his teenage daughter. Forty-one-year-old Rene Lopez now has claim to the longest-known prison sentence assigned to anyone in the history of the Fresno Superior Court. This is the first high profile rape case in recent times that has gained attention for the sentencing of the rapist offering any actual semblance of justice to the victims.
Finally, a just sentence – Father sentenced to 1503 years in prison for raping daughter

Outrage had followed after ex-Stanford swimmer Brock Turner was sentenced to six months in jail and only served three months before being released and last week a Montana man who was convicted of felony incest after raping his 12-year-old daughter only being sentenced to 60 days in jail. However, Rene Lopez had been raping his teenage daughter for over four years, ending in 2013 and had already been found guilty of 186 felony counts of sexual assault, which included dozens of counts of rape of a minor.
The LA Times wrote of the words that accompanied Sarkisian’s verdict to the man, noting that the judge blamed Lopez entirely and told the father that he had violated the position of trust he had been in in regards to being the girl’s father. The California judge also said that the behavior the man had displayed was violent conduct which makes him a “serious danger to society.” The verdict for the 1,503 year prison sentence was delivered to a silent and shackled Lopez, who had mastered the art of never acknowledging his daughter. At no point during the trial had Lopez even shown any remorse for raping his own child and in fact, actually blamed her for the situation he was now in. The daughter, now 23-years-old, told Sarkisian that she still feared her father.
One of the more disturbing details in the case is that the man’s daughter had initially been sexually abused by a friend of the family and Nicole Galstan argued that instead of protecting the teen, Rene Lopez instead turned her into “a piece of property and use her to satisfy his sexual needs.”
The daughter, who has not been named, had been raped about two to three times every week from May 2009 to May 2013, when she was finally able to get up the courage to leave. At the hearing on Friday, Sarkisian read out the date of each attack, highlighting that Rene Lopez used to also rape his daughter on Christmas and other holidays. Once the daughter was out of the house the father did not stop victimizing her however, and would often drive by her new home and leave love songs on her answering machine. Fresno police placed Rene Lopez under arrest in November 2013 after his daughter called the authorities and reported the abuse.

According to theFresno Bee, Sarkisian let it be known that Lopez had turned down two plea deals, refusing to admit his guilt even as the evidence showed otherwise. Before his 1,503 years prison sentence and even before the preliminary court hearing the Fresno prosecutors had been prepared to recommend that the man get up to 13 years in prison but Lopez rejected the offer. Another offer was extended before the trial itself began, this time with a 22 year prison time if he admitted his guilt but once more the offer was rejected.
Lopez did not testify at his trial but later wrote to the judge that his daughter had lied on the witness stand, only providing “hearsay” testimony and his trial had been unfair. The evidence had been overwhelming however and in addition to the testimony the jurors also heard entries from the victim’s diary, in which she had recorded the abuse. The judge said that the father paid to get his daughter an abortion when he got her pregnant after the constant raping.
Sarkisian’s 1,503 years prison sentence for Lopez will also have him registering as a sex offender.

 KICKOFF: Monday, 8:30 p.m. ET, Sports Authority Field at Mile High. TV: ESPN, Sean McDonough, Jon Gruden, Lisa Salters.
 SERIES HISTORY: 6th regular-season meeting. Broncos lead series, 3-2. Broncos have won two of three at home. Most historic meeting between these two teams was on Dec. 26, 2010, when Tim Tebow led the Broncos back from a 17-0 halftime deficit to a 24-23 win in his second career start.
 GAMEDATE: 10/24/16
KEYS TO THE GAME:
Once upon a time -- precisely 11 months ago -- Brock Osweiler burst onto the scene in his first start with the Denver Broncos at Chicago and flashed the kind of promise that led the franchise to believe he could be the QB of the future.
Cash, and the belief by the Houston Texans that Osweiler was the franchise passer owner Bob McNair coveted, led him into a free agency union that didn't involve the Broncos. That sets the stage for Monday's amicable reunion.
 Osweiler stares down the barrel at a Denver defense looking to end a two-game losing streak, but inconsistent play -- perhaps the biggest knock on the 6-foot-8 gunslinger in free agency -- is haunting Houston's offense. Osweiler has eight interceptions, has been sacked 12 times and completed only 59 percent of his passes in the first six games. Considering the Broncos know how to stop Osweiler, an extra dose of RB Lamar Miller is likely.
 Denver's offensive woes can be traced several directions, but noteworthy in this matchup is a scuffling running game averaging 3.8 yards per carry (compared to 4.2 last season).
 The Texans are not entirely equipped to match personnel in the secondary, especially with CB Kevin Johnson (broken foot) hitting IR this week. But without the benefit of balance, QB Trevor Siemian hasn't been able to keep that fire lit.
MATCHUPS TO WATCH:
 --Broncos running backs vs. Texans front seven. Only three teams are allowing more rushing yardage per game than the 126.3 surrendered by the Texans so far this season, and without J.J. Watt to contend with, the Texans could be just what the Broncos' ailing ground game needs. After a strong start in Weeks 1 and 2, the Broncos have averaged just 77.3 rushing yards per game and 3.25 yards per carry, as injuries on the offensive line and an inability to exploit holes when they are created has cost the Broncos.
 --Broncos OLBs Von Miller and Shane Ray vs. Texans QB Brock Osweiler. Through the ups and downs of the season to date, the Broncos' edge rushers have remained a strength, with Miller and Ray combining for 11.5 of the team's 21 sacks through six games. Osweiler has been sacked just once every 19.9 pass plays, a marked improvement from his sack rate of one every 13.0 pass plays last season with the Broncos.
PLAYER SPOTLIGHT:
Bronco C Matt Paradis. The anchor on an offensive line that has struggled to find consistency while dealing with an injury to right tackle Donald Stephenson and the struggles of second-year left guard Max Garcia. Paradis has helped steady Trevor Siemian before the snap and has also been durable, playing every snap since the start of the 2015 regular season.
 INJURY REPORT:
Houston -- Out: S Quintin Demps (calf), CB Kevin Johnson (foot), LB Brian Peters (quadriceps), RB Jonathan Grimes (ankle). Denver -- Out: LB DeMarcus Ware (forearm). Questionable: WR Cody Latimer (concussion), T Russell Okung (concussion).
To fill Kevin Johnson's place on the roster, Houston activated safely Lonnie Ballentine from the physically unable to perform list. Ballentine has been sidelined since suffering a knee injury last season.
 For the Broncos, outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware will miss his fifth consecutive game due to a fractured forearm.
 Ware was injured in a Week 2 victory over Indianapolis and has not practiced since.
 Denver is still waiting to see on the availability of left tackle Russell Okung and wide receiver Cody Latimer, who are in the league's concussion protocol.
 Both players are scheduled for a final league-mandated examination in order to be cleared to play.
 FAST FACTS:
The Broncos have a league-worst minus-28 scoring differential in the first quarter. ... Broncos CB Aqib Talib has 33 career interceptions for the most of any cornerback since he entered the league in 2008.
PREDICTION:
Denver will get the best Brock Osweiler can offer with a real-life prove-it plot in play, but the Broncos' defense holds the edge in the secondary and with a pass rush planning to deliver its own message on ""Monday Night Football.""

563aff5f,http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/trump-clap-back-michelle-obama/1667240/,Trump Just Tried To Clap Back At Michelle Obama And No One's Having It,"For some strange reason, Donald Trump thought it would be wise to go after America’s queen, Michelle Obama.
Last week, MObama gave a passionate speech against Trump… without once uttering his name. She talked about how his language of predatory sexual behavior shook her to her core, and how it must be rejected.
So Trump – who is dropping in the polls – decided it was time to attack the First Lady, who has a higher public approval rating than Bill Clinton and Melania Trump.
During a campaign rally on Friday, the Republican presidential nominee started by going after President Barack Obama. He said,
We have a bunch of babies running our country, folks. We have a bunch of losers.
We have a president, all he wants to do is campaign.
This comes days after the president said,
I’d invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.
Then, Donald went after Michelle, saying that she too only wants to campaign.
He then started talking about how much Obama “likes Hillary,” given the campaigning she is doing for her. Trump says,
But wasn’t she the one that originally started the statement, ‘If you can’t take care of your home, you can’t take care of the White House’?
Trump supporters have been resurfacing a 2007 clip of Michelle in an attempt to discredit her current support for Clinton.
Indeed, Obama said in 2007 that she believes if you can’t take care of your home, you can’t take care of the White House.
Trump uses this as an excuse for why he has been using Bill Clinton’s sexual assault accusers against Hillary.
Trump says,
I said, ‘We can’t say that, it’s too vicious.’
But then, he says that he found out Obama had said it.
But here’s the thing: Obama did not say that about Clinton. She was talking about Barack and herself, and how they were running the campaign. During a campaign stop in Iowa in 2007 – according to Politifact – Obama said,
One of the most important things that we need to know about the next president of the United States is, is he somebody that shares our values? Is he somebody that respects family? Is (he) a good and decent person?
So our view was that, if you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House. So, we’ve adjusted our schedules to make sure that our girls are first, so while he’s traveling around, I do day trips.
If you want to believe that Obama said what he did to subtly make a jab about Clinton not being able to stop her husband from having affairs and carrying on questionable sexual behavior, that’s your prerogative. But the context does not support your case.
Barack Obama said in a conference call in 2007 that what his wife said was not about the Clintons. He said,
There was no reference beyond her point that we have had an administration that talks a lot about family values but doesn’t follow through.
When Trump goes low, Obama goes high. And when Obama goes high, we all know where Trump goes.

Modern Family star Ariel Winter has a great track record as a body-positive role model. She is so outspoken about her journey to feeling happy in her own skin and knows how to handle bullies without dimming her shine. That’s why we love this explanation of why she wore a swimsuit, shorts, and heels on the red carpet over the summer.
Ariel debuted this look at the Just Jared 4th Annual Summer Bash hosted by Uno in Los Angeles in July. Some fans loved the look and some people hated it, but it definitely got people talking.
It’s true, this is a real outfit she rocked on the red carpet! 
JB Lacroix/Getty Images
In a recent interview with People about her most controversial outfits, Ariel talked about the look. She said:
 “I’m a big fan of swimsuits, short shorts, and pumps. I know it sounds so ridiculous but I’m a huge fan. I go to pool parties in that all the time. I love the cutouts and the see-through stripes on the swimsuit, and then I put it with the shorts and I’m like, ‘I’m ready to go swimming or I’m ready to party.’ You’re ready for whatever.” 
JB Lacroix/Getty Images
We think it’s so cool how much Ariel is in love with this look. It’s definitely unexpected, but she totally rocks it! We also think it’s completely genius that she’s perfected a look that is both party-ready and pool-ready. The cutout detailing in her suit is so pretty, and the shorts and pumps elevate it to a totally glamorous level!
So thank you to Ariel Winter for giving us a cool fashion dare! We might have to try this one out a pool party ourselves.

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s divorce may come to a halt, and if it happens, their children may just take credit for it.
Pitt and Jolie’s divorce has been nothing short of controversial, which isn’t at all surprising considering the circumstances that led to their breakup. But now Brangelina fans may have good enough reason to not lose hope yet, as Hollywood Life reports that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s divorce may be retracted.
“The ice between him and Angie is starting to thaw,” a source said. “A week ago, it seemed impossible that they would ever get past this, but things are shifting. There does seem to be a glimmer of hope.”
Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie Reconciling? There’s A Glimmer Of Hope https://t.co/LOQ8qHG1Xd
— HollywoodLife (@HollywoodLife) October 21, 2016
Angelina and Brad’s divorce has been messy, what with the pair having some major disagreements when it comes to the custody of their six kids. Since the ugly airplane incident involving an alleged physical altercation with son Maddox, Pitt has been embroiled with a child abuse case filed against him by Jolie. This made the Allied actor especially afraid of the possibility that he may not see his children again.
But it looks like things are now mended between Pitt and Maddox as the two personally met for the first time since their fight on the plane, as reported by TMZ. As is required in Pitt and Jolie’s temporary custody agreement, a therapist also attended the reunion. The meeting was supposed to have happened sooner but the therapist felt at the time that the timing wasn’t right until Wednesday.
The insider said that while Brad came out of the meeting with a lot of hope, the meeting was “still depressing as hell for him because it was a reminder of what he’s lost.”
“He feels rock bottom without his family, it’s a pain he never imagined he’d feel and every day it gets harder to be apart from them.”
Pitt already reunited with his five other children, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, Vivienne and Knox, 8, on October 8, and has met them face-to-face a second time. The meetings were supervised, as ordered by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, the agency currently investigating Pitt.
The FBI confirmed that they are “gathering facts” on the case and will soon decide whether they need to conduct a full federal investigation.

— Us Weekly (@usweekly) October 20, 2016
As per the terms stipulated in the former couple’s temporary agreement, the therapist is scheduled to come to a decision about the terms of the custody on October 20.
According to divorce documents signed by Jolie, the Maleficent actress asked for sole physical custody of all six children, but Pitt is reportedly cooperating with authorities to ensure that that doesn’t happen. He denied that he physically abused his children, especially Maddox. However, there are sources who claim that he admitted to “putting his hands on” the 15-year-old Maddox while they were on the plane.
Angelina Jolie, 41, adopted Maddox in 2002, around two years before the actress met Pitt on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Having established a family even before Pitt, Jolie and Maddox had a special bond.
“Maddox is very close with Angie,” a source close to Jolie told US Weekly.
Over 10 years ago, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie went public with their relationship. Brad officially adopted Maddox in 2006.
Sources told TMZ that Pitt missed the Wednesday deadline this week in filing a legal response to his ex-wife’s divorce petition.
The showbiz site says that the actor chose not to answer the petition because he wants to avoid a legal battle with Jolie. According to the report, Pitt wants to avoid the legal battle because custody rights “would cause great psychological damage to their kids.
Insiders claim that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s divorce case may be settled privately.

4ec17fae,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/calif-teacher-slashes-throat-sex-assault-verdict-read-article-1.2838160,Calif. teacher slashes throat after sex assault verdict is read,"A California teacher convicted of sexually assaulting a teenager slashed his throat with a razor blade in court immediately after hearing the verdict on Wednesday.

Jeffrey Scott Jones, 56, was accused of molesting and having sex with a teen relative of his live-in girlfriend in 2012 and 2013.

Prosecutors said DNA evidence pointed to Jones, and claimed that he had relationships with two underage girls who he later married, according to CBS in Los Angeles.

The defense argued the DNA wasn't conclusive and the girl lied to cover up her marijuana use.

A Santa Ana jury deliberated for two hours before convicting Jones of continuous sexual abuse and aggravated sexual assault of a child. It was then that he took action and injured himself.

Jeffrey Scott Jones was found guilty of molesting and having sex with a teen.

""Right after the judge asked if we wanted jurors polled, both attorneys said no, and then he took a razor out of his left pocket and slashed his throat,"" prosecutor Heather Brown told CBS in Los Angeles. ""His head hit the table, and I thought he fainted. But then I saw the blood and the razor on the table.""

Authorities are unsure how Jones, who had been free on bail, managed to get the razor blade through security.

""I didn’t see it even though I was sitting next to him,” defense attorney Ed Welbourn told the station. ""At that point, he passed out or something happened and he hit the table, which is when I noticed something was happening.""

Jones, who taught Advanced Placement English classes at the Libra Academy in Huntington Park, is facing a potential sentence of 66 years to life in prison. He was rushed to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

It took two hours for a jury to convict Jones, a teacher.

""It's very unfortunate, the whole thing,"" Welbourn told CBS. ""We respect the jury's decision, but we thought there was reasonable doubt as to what occurred ... It's just terrible. The good news is it looks like he will recover.""

However, the only good news for Jones' Huntington Beach neighbors was that he was convicted.

""I taught my daughter how to use my shotgun and told her if he ever comes into the house, shoot him,"" Ken Deleske told CBS.","scott jone,sexual,convict,throat,razor,jone,juri,slash,molest,dna"

5801d116,http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/213138569-story,Five car crash victims wait nearly 3 hours for police to arrive,"DETROIT (WJBK) - A few people involved in a multi-vehicle crash on Saturday afternoon at the corner of Telegraph and Grand River are upset after it took officers a few hours to arrive on scene.
A 17-year-old driving an SUV shortly before 3 p.m. rear-ended a woman in her Lexus and sideswiped a man in his Saturn.
The teen and his guardian didn't have anything to say to FOX 2 or the people involved in the multi-vehicle crash.
They only spoke with Detroit officers who arrived on scene, and police didn't arrive on scene until after 6 p.m.
""The officer said that he apologized and he said unfortunately it is a shortage of vehicles and the priorities and because they have a lack of the help they need, unfortunately (there) was no car to send out,"" said Dariel Powell, whose sister was involved in the crash.
The spokesperson for Detroit police says the department was responding to between three to five other calls that were more urgent at this time of this report.
However, the spokesperson couldn't specify if the calls involved violent crimes or more serious crashes.
In the end, this one fell onto a lower priority list since no one here was seriously injured, and the spokesperson says he doesn't know of any shortage of squad vehicles.
But Powell says had officers arrived here at the scene sooner, they may have been able to prevent a second crash at the same location.
""Because an hour later, someone else hit somebody else. It's an 18-wheeler involved. It's another gentleman's car involved and ... if the police had been here on time, that accident could have been prevented,"" she said.
During the three-hour wait period, the people involved in the crash say EMS and officers from another jurisdiction arrived to check on everyone.
Powell's sister Paulyette Evans was driving the Lexus.
Although this may not have been a life and death situation, she doesn't accept waiting several hours after police had been called.
This is someone who currently lives in the suburbs, and is considering moving back into city, but unfortunately she is now rethinking that idea.
""I had my heart set on moving back into the Detroit area, into the Sherwood Forrest, Palmer Woods area, but if this is the kind of service we get with the expensive tax dollars paid here in the city, perhaps I need to rethink my decision,"" Evans said.

The maid/matron of honor is part worker bee, part emotional lifeboat. Chosen for your energetic, get-the-ball-in-motion qualities, you should also remember that listening to the bride, making her laugh, and offering emotional and logistical support are also part of your honor attendant package. Here's what's expected:
Lead the bridesmaid troupe. It's the maid/matron of honor's (MOH) job to direct the other maids through their duties. Make sure everyone gets their bridesmaid dresses, go to dress fittings, and find the right jewelry. Also provide them with the 411 on all prewedding parties. 
Help shop for dresses (the bride's and the bridesmaids'). And the MOH pays for her own entire wedding outfit (including shoes). 
Offer to help the bride with prewedding tasks, from addressing invites to choosing the wedding colors and nodding enthusiastically when she waxes poetic about wedding cake. 
Spread the news about where the bride and groom are registered. 
Help the bride change for her honeymoon and take charge of her gown after the ceremony. Arrange for storage in a safe place until she returns. 
Lend an ear. Whether it's about the planning, the marriage, or the registry china patterns, the MOH should assure the bride that she has someone with whom she can share her thoughts. Even if she seems to dwell on the same subjects repeatedly, the MOH keeps listening.
Host or cohost a bridal shower for the bride. 
Attend all prewedding parties. 
Keep a record of all the gifts received at various parties and showers (or delegate a bridesmaid to handle this). 
Plan the bachelorette party with the bridesmaids. 
See to it that all bridesmaids get to the rehearsal; coordinate transportation and lodging, if necessary. 
Make sure that all bridesmaids get their hair and makeup done, get to the ceremony on time, and have the correct bouquets. 
Hold the groom's ring during the ceremony. Safest place to put it? On your thumb. 
Arrange the bride's train and veil before the ceremony begins and just after she arrives at the altar. The MOH might also need to help her bustle the train for easy dancing at the reception. 
Hold the bride's bouquet while the couple exchanges vows. 
Sign the marriage license as a witness, along with the best man. 
Stand next to the groom in the receiving line (this is optional; the bride may decide to have attendants circulate among the guests instead). 
Play hostess along with the other bridesmaids at frequent points during the reception: show guests where to sit, direct them to restrooms, tell them to where to put presents, invite them to sign the guest book, etc. 
Collect any gift envelopes brought to the reception and keep them in a safe place. 
Make sure the bride takes a moment to eat something -- refresh her drink, get her a plate of food from the buffet table, or instruct the wait staff to keep her entree warm. 
 Dance with the best man during the formal first-dance sequence and possibly be announced with him at the beginning of the party. Also dance with other groomsmen, the groom, and others throughout the musical entertainment.
Toast the couple after the best man. (This is optional, but it is a nice touch.) 
Troubleshoot emotional crises. In most cases, this will require lots of tissues, hugging, and hair-smoothing. The MOH continues to be a trusted friend, a good listener, and a smart advisor. 
Keep the bride laughing. For the stressed-out bride, laughter can be as effective as venting.

 DENVER (AP) -  
Brock Osweiler is back in Denver Monday night as the Broncos face the Houston Texans at Mile High Stadium.
Each team is off to a 4-2 start and tonight's game is just the sixth between the teams.
The game marks the return of Brock Osweiler, who served as Denver's backup quarterback last season before leaving for the Texans as a free agent in the off season.
Osweiler swears he meant no disrespect to Denver when he said at his introductory news conference in Houston that he chose the Texans over the Broncos in free agency because they gave him the ""best opportunity to be successful.""
Osweiler is coming off his best game as a Texan, leading Houston back from a 14-point deficit for a 26-23 win in overtime against the Colts last week.
Siemian is coming off his first loss, 21-13 at San Diego, where he was still compromised by a sprained left shoulder that had sidelined him the week before.

af10fbed,http://larrybrownsports.com/football/mike-zimmer-loss-eagles-embarrassing/329932,Mike Zimmer calls loss to Eagles 'embarrassing',"Mike Zimmer was all over his Minnesota Vikings after their loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, which he termed “embarrassing.”
But Zimmer’s criticism of his previously undefeated Vikings did not end there; he also called his offensive line “soft.”
“It was embarrassing in at least two of the phases,” Zimmer said after the game Sunday, via the Minneapolis Star Tribune. “And I’m very disappointed in the performance that we gave today. We turned the ball over offensively, we didn’t block people, we dropped balls, we got the quarterback hit, we [need] two inches and we can’t convert on third down or fourth down, we got three shots in the red zone in the first half, we throw an interception, we gave up a 98-yard kickoff return, we fumbled a punt. If you’re going to do those things, you have no chance to win.”
The Vikings only rushed for 93 yards in the 21-10 loss. They fumbled the ball five times, losing three of them, which is highly troubling for any offense. 
The team’s patch-work offensive line that has been hit with injuries struggled too. 
“We didn’t block anybody,” he said. “We were soft. We got overpowered.”
With Zimmer holding his team to such high standards, it’s easy to see why they’ve gone 5-1 to start the year. They will look to turn things around when they face the Chicago Bears next Monday night.

Is Julian Assange dead? Recent WikiLeaks tweets led to speculation that the founder of the controversial organization passed away on Sunday night, a news that spread like wildfire online.
WikiLeaks posted cryptic numeric tweets on Friday night, which was seen as signals that a dead man’s switch was activated. And because of that, most people online speculated that that Assange is in danger or dead.
Most netizens looked back at a protocol in 2010, which was arranged for Assange’s safety. It was reported that when something happens to the WikiLeaks founder, a code will be activated, unleashing controversial information that will spread worldwide and will not be stopped.
This is the main reason why Julian Assange dead talks made waves online, as no one can explain the series of tweets from WikiLeaks. But are the Julian Assange dead reports accurate?
According to Snopes, a Twitter account that belongs to Anonymous claimed that there is nothing to worry about Assange because the tweets were not deadman keys. The mysterious Twitter account then added that the WikiLeaks founder is safe and sound.
Gizmodo also had an interesting take on the cryptic posts on Twitter. According to the report, the Twitter posts might have a special meaning, which will prove in the future that a certain information is real.
“Much as these tweets provide great fodder for conspiracy speculation, the secret to their meaning is hidden in plain sight,” Gizmodo noted. “Pre-commitment in this case is a references to a cryptographic scheme to prevent unreleased information from being tampered with.”
WikiLeaks also provided their own explanation on Monday. They said that the Assange’s internet link was cut off and that they have activated contingency plans. According to BBC, Ecuador blocked internet access for Assange, but the main reason for the said action is still unknown at this point.
However, netizens cannot help but wonder if it has something to do with the recent WikiLeaks revelations. They have been revealing sensitive emails from Hillary Clinton and her ongoing presidential campaign in the United States.

Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx are reportedly ready to tie the knot, but Tom Cruise doesn’t seem to be too pleased with the idea. The “Mission Impossible” actor, reportedly, doesn’t approve of Foxx coming into his daughter Suri’s life and this could end up delaying the wedding which was scheduled for November.
According to a report by the In Touch Weekly, Holmes was spotted wearing a diamond ring on her engagement finger and hence the rumoured couple would soon be walking down the aisle to start off on a new journey together.
Although the representatives of both the stars have denied any possibility of a wedding, friends and close acquaintances have confirmed that the duo is going strong.
According to a source, Holmes and Foxx are not only gearing up to declare themselves not only as a couple but an engaged couple. The source added that the two have also discussed the feasibility of eloping and having a private wedding, the Headlines & Global News reported.
The rumours around their affair have been doing the rounds since 2014 and ever since Holmes was spotted wearing the ring on her engagement finger, speculations on a possible wedding became rampant.
However Gossip Cop debunked this, claiming that both Katie Holmes and Foxx have confirmed separately that they are nothing more than friends. Despite all the tittle-tattle the two have denied the rumours.
There were also rumours that Holmes and Foxx have kept their relationship a secret because of the divorce agreement between the actress and Cruise, which barred Holmes from publicly dating someone till 2017. The rumours also had it that although Holmes got the custody of their daughter, Cruise has still been seeking full custody of Suri, the Chatt Sports Net reported.
However, according to the recent rumours, Cruise is not comfortable with the idea that Foxx will become the second father to Suri. Foxx is purportedly planning to adopt Suri and even Holmes is wary of what Cruise might make of it.

The twenty-something woman from Wynne, Arkansas has Harlequin ichthyosis. 
“At birth, the child’s whole body is encased in an “armor” of thick white plates of skin, separated with deep cracks,” according to Wikipedia. “In addition, the eyes, ears and limbs may be abnormally contracted. Because of resultant cracked skin in locations where normal skin would fold, it is easily pregnable by bacteria and other contaminants, which can result in serious risk of fatal infection.” 
When Stephanie was born, doctors said it was unlikely she would survive — but she continued to defy all odds stacked against her. She attributes much of her survival to a life-saving cream she applies every day, which prevents bacteria and lubricates her rough skin. 
Stephanie is currently the oldest female in the United States to have this rare condition. Unfortunately, she became no stranger to nasty comments and bullying. Strangers have approached her to ask if she is a burn victim. 
But there’s another reason why Stephanie has surpassed the doctor’s expectations, and that is her unbelievably positive attitude towards life. In fact, it was her upbeat outlook that made her husband fall in love with her.
Soon after she got married, Stephanie became pregnant at the age of 23 — but she knew that having a baby possibly meant risking her life. Pregnancy in women with Harlequin ichthyosis can be highly dangerous because the stretching of the stomach can make the condition worse.
The doctors had no idea what to expect from Stephanie’s pregnancy and delivery; they’d never seen a case like this before.
Defying all odds once again, Stephanie delivered a healthy son. She is the first person with Harlequin ichthyosis to give birth! Stephanie and her husband went on to get pregnant a second time and welcome a healthy baby girl into the world.
She did not pass the condition onto either of her children because both parents must have Harlequin to be passed down.
Meet this incredible, inspiring mother below, and please SHARE Stephanie’s story with your friends on Facebook!

According to reports, Hayley Sulley and Della Woods starved their dog for two days before he attacked the 79-year-old Clifford Clarke. Sulley and Woods ignored their dog Charlie for two days and allowed him to run around their yard freely, so when neighbor Clifford Clarke opened his door, the dog ran and mauled him to death.
Prior to eating Clarke alive, the dog was so hungry that it attempted to eat a plastic bowl and some cigarette butts. When a neighbor noticed the dog foaming at the mouth, the police were called, but by the time they arrived, Clarke had already been eaten by the ravenous dog. Police say that the dog even tried to eat the end of the gun used to kill it. The brutal killing was described in court proceedings, as it appears the dog literally amputated one of Clarke’s arms.
“I am satisfied this dreadful and forceful attack on Mr. Clarke was entirely avoidable,” said Judge Mark Brown to the women in court. “Mr. Clarke was literally eaten alive by Charlie when large amounts of tissue were ingested by the dog and that is a very shocking, appalling and tragic event. Mr. Clarke suffered a horrific death and you have taken away from his family the love and companionship he would have provided.”
Prosecutor Gary Simpson said that the women deserve their sentence for allowing their dog to get to the point it did, ultimately ending in an innocent man’s death.
“This was a vicious attack on a defenseless man who was powerless to fight back against this large and powerful dog,” said Simpson. “The guilty pleas of these two women have thankfully brought this case to a relatively speedy conclusion and have saved Mr. Clarke’s relatives the ordeal of a trial. Hayley Sulley and Della Woods were both responsible for the dog’s welfare and behavior on that fateful day. Their failure to make sure the dog was cared for and under control has led to a man’s death and they must now come to terms with that. Our thoughts are with the family of Mr. Clarke at this sad time.”
Once they are done serving their prison sentence, both Sulley and Woods are banned from ever owning another dog again.

The objectives were classic Trump: remain confident and composed, combat the narrative that the campaign is in a tailspin ― and above all else, remind people that Donald Trump is a winner.
In truth though, Trump’s body language told a different story. A post-debate clip shows the real estate mogul seething while he tears a page out of his notepad. He then tries to regain his cool as his opponent Hillary Clinton walks by to shake hands. 
Yup pic.twitter.com/vDf6G8bRmZ
— Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) October 20, 2016 
Here’s another angle, this time with a Johnny Cash soundtrack.
It’s not clear why Trump was upset. Perhaps he understood that he’d just blown the debate by refusing once again to say he’d accept the results of the election, a move that could subvert the democratic process. Maybe his rage was directed toward Clinton, whom he’d just called a “nasty woman.” Or maybe he was simply frustrated that his chances of avoiding total humiliation on Nov. 8 appear to be dwindling with each passing day. 
Current predictions suggest Trump has less than a 5 percent chance of winning next month, with polls showing him trailing by substantial margins in a number of key battleground states.
With such a steep hill to climb, Trump’s own demeanor is increasingly defying the portrait of success he’s spent the past three decades painting. At Wednesday’s debate, Trump seemingly acknowledged that Clinton is likely to beat him, making an offhand remark wishing her luck in the coming years.

1974c171,http://www.globalresearch.ca/more-dangerous-than-the-cold-war-by-cooperating-with-washington-on-syria-russia-walked-into-a-trap/5552641,"""More Dangerous than the Cold War"": By Cooperating With Washington On Syria Russia Walked Into A Trap","The consequences of this hesitation are now apparent:
1. A UN report orchestrated by Washington has accused Syria and Russia of war crimes in Aleppo. According to the report,
“indiscriminate airstrikes across the eastern part of the city by Government forces and their allies [Russia] are responsible for the overwhelming majority of civilian casualties. These violations constitute war crimes. And if knowingly committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against civilians, they constitute crimes against humanity.”
The UN Human Rights Council has now voted to start an “independent” investigation. The purpose of the investigation is to indict Russia and Putin as war criminals and to “bring to justice those responsible for the alleged abuses.” Moreover,
“the situation should be urgently referred to the International Criminal Court. Every party to this conflict must know that they will be held accountable for the international crimes they commit – all, without selective protection or discrimination.”
Keep in mind that Washington provides the largest share of the UN’s budget, and the UN will overlook that it was Washington that sent ISIS to Aleppo.
Obviously, neither Washington nor the UN will be able to drag Putin into the International Criminal Court, but a war criminal charge can serve Washington’s purpose by stopping Putin from traveling abroad and curtailing his diplomatic efforts. The purpose of this orchestrated exercise is its propaganda value. Among Washington’s many concerns is that some Eastern European countries, alarmed by the conflict that Washington is leading them into with Russia, will threaten NATO with a non-participation statement. If Russia is branded a war criminal, it becomes even more difficult for countries that foolishly and thoughtlessly joined NATO to extricate themselves from the consequences.
2. Washington has succeeded in bringing to power in Poland the far right-wing Law and Justice Party. These agents of Washington have re-opened the matter of the death of Poland’s President Kaczynski in a plane crash, making wild claims that the crash was a terror attack by Russia aimed at depriving Poland of its political leadership
Despite massive and convincing evidence to the contrary, the Law and Justice Party’s claims will find traction thanks to the scary portrait of Russia painted by Washington’s demonization campaign. The intended result is to further blacken and isolate Russia and its government.
3. As the anointed spokesperson for the neoconservative warmongers, Hillary wants Washington to enforce a no-fly zone in Syria. A no-fly zone would require Washington to attemp to prevent Syrian and Russian air strikes against ISIS positions. It seems clear enough that Syria and Russia would not accept any attempt to deny Syria the use of the country’s own airspace in the conflict against forces sent by Washington to overthrow the Syrian government, as happened to Gaddafi in Libya. Unless Russia and Syria surrender, Hillary’s no-fly zone would result in military conflict between Russia and the US.
To advance the no-fly zone proposal, the “use of chemical weapons” ruse has been resurrected. Fabricated reports are appearing that the Syrian airforce is guilty of dropping chemical weapons on the Syrian population. On October 22, the Indian Express reported that on October 21 the UN-Led Joint Investigative Mechanism informed the UN Security Council that the chemical attack on Qmenas
“was caused by a Syrian Arab Armed Forces helicopter dropping a device from a high altitude which hit the ground and released the toxic substance that affected the population.”
The report concluded that three of the chemical attacks investigated were made by Syria and one by the Islamic State.
The fact that the Russians resolved the chemical weapons issue in 2014, a year before the alleged attack on Qmenas, by taking possession of the weapons and removing them from Syria means that the report has little credibility. http://www.wsj.com/articles/removal-of-chemical-weapons-from-syria-is-completed-1403529356 
However, at no time during Washington’s 15-year-old attack on Muslim countries have facts played any role, and certainly facts have played no role in Washington’s demonization of Russia.
4. Diana Johnstone has concluded that Hillary intends regime change for Russia and will use the presidency for that purpose.
It is impossible to imagine a purpose more reckless and irresponsible. Many members of the Russian government have stated that Washington’s provocation and demonization of Russia have brought trust between the nuclear powers close to zero and that Russia will never again fight a war on her own territory. Sergey Karaganov told the German news magazine, Der Spiegal, that if Washington and NATO move from provocations to encroachments against Russia, a nuclear power, they will be punished.
Many foolish people believe that nuclear war cannot happen, because there can be no winner.
However, the American war planners, who elevated US nuclear weapons from a retaliatory role to a pre-emptive first strike function, obviously do not agree that nuclear war cannot be won. If nuclear war is believed to be unwinable, there is no point in a war doctrine that assigns the weapons the role of surprise attack.
The Russians are aware and disturbed that Washington has made the situation between the US and Russia more dangerous than during the Cold War. Vladimir Putin himself has stated that the West does not hear his warnings. In an effort to avoid war, Putin wrings everything possible out of diplomacy. He enters into agreements with Washington that he must know will not be kept.
So much has happened to teach him this lesson— the Washington instigated invasion of South Ossetia by Georgia while he was at the Beijing Olympics, Washington’s coup in Ukraine while he was at the Sochi Olympics, Washington’s abandonment of the Minsk Agreement, the advantage Washington took of the Syrian ceasefire agreements, the violation of Washington’s promise not to move NATO to Russia’s border, Washington’s sacking of the Anti-ABM Treaty, the orchestrated blame of Russia for MH-17, Hillary’s hacked emails, etc.
Washington clearly intends to use Russia’s military and diplomatic assistance to Syria to convict Russia in world public opinion of war crimes. It was Russia’s hesitancy in Syria that enabled Washington to recover from the defeat of its ISIS mercenaries and substitute control of the explanation for defeat on the ground.
Russia’s air assault on ISIS in Syria caught Washington off guard and quickly rolled up the Washington-supported ISIS forces, completely reversing the tide of war. Had Russia finished the job, Syria would have been cleared of hostile forces before Washington could catch its breath.
Instead, pressured by the Atlanticist Integrationist element in the Russian elite, the Russian government withdrew, announcing mission accomplished and relying on the Syrian Army to complete the job. This strategic error allowed Washington not merely to replenish the ISIS munitions that had been destroyed and to muster more mercenaries, but more importantly to come up with a plan for Russia’s and Assad’s undoing.
By the time that the Russian government realized that early withdrawal was a mistake and re-entered the conflict, Washington had decided that if Dasmacus could not be “liberated,” Syria could be partitioned and pressure kept on Assad in that way. Yet the Russian government continued to postpone victory by cease fire agreements that Washington used to rearm ISIS and as propaganda weapons against Russia.
Whatever the outcome of the military conflict in Syria, Russia faces a war criminal conviction by the Western media, if not by the UN Human Rights Council, and a no-fly zone in Syria if Hillary becomes president of the US.
This is the huge cost that Putin paid for listening to the unrealistic, American-worshipping Atlanticist Integrationists who are determined that Russia be accepted by the West even if it means being a semi-vassal.
If there is nuclear war, the Russian Atlanticist Integrationists will share the blame with the American neoconservatives. And all of us will pay the price for the disaster produced by these few, the neoconservatives demanding war and the Atlanticist Integrationists demanding appeasement of Washington.

2bd4bed7,http://isportsweb.com/2016/10/23/ohio-state-football/,"Ohio State Football: Buckeyes' Big Ten, Playoff chances far from over","With just under four minutes to go against the Penn State Nittany Lions, it looked as though the Buckeyes were about to extend their lead to 24-17.
A blocked field goal, however, quickly turned the game on its head.
Penn State safety Marcus Allen blocked the Tyler Durbin kick, and cornerback Grant Haley finished the broken play for a touchdown to take the lead 24-21.
The Buckeyes couldn’t respond on the ensuing drive, and the Nittany Lions registered their first win against Ohio State since 2011.

Buckeye faithful, without question, are disappointed with last night’s result, but Ohio State still has a chance at Big Ten Championship, and possibly the College Football Playoff.
With their three point win on Saturday, Penn State improves to 5-2, with losses to Pittsburgh and Michigan. At 3-1 in the Big Ten, the Nittany Lions will have to rely on Michigan losing sometime this season to advance to the Big Ten Championship.
That’s where the Buckeyes come in.
If Ohio State can run the table and defeat the Wolverines at home, there will be a three-way tie at the top of the Big Ten East Conference.
At that point, the Big Ten Championship berth will go to the highest ranked team. And for Ohio State, with impressive victories against Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and hypothetically Michigan and Nebraska, Urban Meyer’s squad will likely regain their ranking in the polls.
Head Coach Urban Meyer reaffirmed that claim during the post-game press conference.
“Every goal is still alive,” said Meyer.
Obviously, with two games against top ten opponents in the near future, the 6-1 Buckeyes will have to improve quickly if they are to run the table. 
With that being said, don’t forget that this is the youngest team in all of college football.
Each proceeding game can only help the young Buckeyes, and with both Nebraska and Michigan at home, Ohio State’s chances at the Big Ten Championship are still very much within reach.

6f61d4f1,http://www.menshealth.co.uk/sex/5-scary-things-that-happen-to-your-penis-when-you-age,Scary Things That Happen to Your Penis When You Age,"This is not a story about what might happen to your penis as you age. It’s not about potential risks or what happen when, say, you “accidentally” put your dong in a hay bailer. (For the record, please don't do that. Ever.) These are things that will, in all likelihood, be happening to your manhood eventually. We spoke to Brian Steixner, MD, the director of the Institute of Men’s Health for the Jersey Urology Group, and asked for all the uncomfortable details. Brace your young self for a look forward into how the ravages of time will take their toll.
The droop
According to Steixner—and verified by the naked guys over 70 shuffling around every health club locker room coast to coast—your scrotum will droop as you get older. It’s an unavoidable aspect of manly aging thanks to a loss in muscle mass. At its most extreme, you develop what Steixner calls “splash down” syndrome, which is exactly what it sounds like. When you sit to use the toilet, your scrotum actually hits the water.
There’s hope, however, thanks to an increasingly popular procedure called scrotoplasty. That’s right, you can get a sack-job and spare your septuagenarian self the indignity of the splash down.
There will be shrinkage
No, not the out-of-the-pool constriction we all know. This is a persistent, progressive loss of size as you age. What does that equation look like? Normal cells, once hale and hearty, get replaced by non-elastic fibers called collagen, which just sort of reel in the whole apparatus.
Want to make it worse? Keep building up that beer gut. As your belly gets bigger, the fat pad pushes out and a larger penile percentage gets buried under the skin. Gain weight, lose length. Simple math. “For every 30 pounds you shed, you add an effective half-inch in length,” says Steixner.
Going around the bend
Into your autumn years, you develop curvature. You’ll dogleg left. You’ll pull right. Thanks to repeated trauma from seemingly harmless things like sports and sexual activity, scar tissue is accumulating along the length of your penis. And if that isn’t unsettling enough, this scar tissue does not build up symmetrically. Where you were once an arrow, you become a bow.
“Into your 60s and 70s,” says Steixner, “it can get worse and worse. I’ve seen patients (whose penises) look for all appearances like a question mark.” Mercifully, there’s help for punctuation mark syndrome. Today, injectable medicines help release the accumulated plaques anchoring the scar tissue holding your penis in that curve. It’s actually a botulinum toxin that does the trick. That’s right, botox injections. Down below. Bite your lip and think happy thoughts.
Erectile dysfunction
There are more than 30 million men with ED, and the reason behind it boils down to blood loss. “Having ED is like having a heart attack of the penis,” explains Steixner. “And preventing it involves pretty much the same advice you give to someone with a heart condition. Eat well, exercise—control those and you should be fine.”
Contending with ED is a billion-dollar market, with treatments from prescription pills and injections to boost blood flow, to penile implants designed to give men a natural erection without medicine. “If you take care of yourself, however, you can avoid all that,” Steixner says. “I have patients in their 90s who have perfect erections because they’ve taken care of themselves.” Finally, some encouraging news.
The Big C
Most men are familiar with the very real risks of prostate and testicular cancer, and symptoms of these are something to watch for as you age. But there’s also a risk of skin cancer on the penis itself, especially if you’re a nudist or like to frequent tanning beds au natural. Also, men who are uncircumcised but remiss in their personal hygiene can create conditions that contribute to skin cancer. “Stay out of tanning beds, and if you are uncircumcised, keep the hood clean,” urges Steixner.
What’s the worst that can happen? Don’t ask. Okay, you asked: “In extreme cases, a complete removal of the penis is required,” Steixner says. “It happens. Maybe once a year. I have a patient—"" Stop there, doc. Please. Just stop there. No tanning beds. Stay clean. We got it.
As for the less horrifying, more likely changes we talked about at first, know that as you age, your testosterone levels will decrease. That means slight but consistent loss in size. You can also look forward to decreased nerve function and sensitivity, which means difficulty achieving orgasm. In other words, your old man penis is going to last longer, but get shorter. Ponder that good-news/bad-news scenario at your retirement party. And don’t forget that it could be worse. So, so much worse.

Alessandra Ambrosio bares her cleavage and midriff as she heads to the gym in tight black workout gear,"As legions rested, Alessandra Ambrosio spent her Sunday working up a sweat.
The Victoria's Secret Angel was spotted maintaining the figure that made her one with a trip to a Tracy Anderson gym in Malibu.
Her seemingly airtight workout gear bared not only her bulging cleavage, but also her enviably flat midriff as she crossed the car park.

The 35-year-old had pulled on a pair of high-waisted black leggings that were rolled up to the knee and framed her svelte legs.
Despite the fact she was heading to a workout, she'd popped on a healthy amount of jewellery: not only a gleaming necklace, but several bracelets and rings as wella s a pair of earrings.
A white purse with a tassel dangled from her right shoulder, artfully matching the white trainers she wore for her exercise trip.

This June, the Erechim native spoke to Vogue Paris and divulged a few details about how she pummels her body into such exquisite form.
'I love swimming and playing volleyball, either on the beach or in the pool,' she said, adding: 'Jumping right in and fully immersing myself in the water is my remedy for easing the pressure when it's all getting a bit too much.'
Whilst she didn't hold forth on her entire nutrition regime, she did describe her 'perfect breakfast' as 'an avocado with a freshly squeezed juice, a big cup of coffee, and boiled or fried eggs lightly browned with coconut oil. You can't beat it.'

In an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” the Republican strategist said that Donald Trump’s poll numbers are simply too dismal to end in victory on election night.
“I don’t see it happening,” Rove told Fox. “If he plays an inside straight, he could get it, but I doubt he’s going to be able to play it.”
Rove explained Trump’s electoral vote deficit, swing state by swing state. Mitt Romney only won 206 electoral votes in 2012, and according to Rove’s judgment, Trump can only feel comfortable about 168, with just over two weeks to go before the Nov. 8 election.
Trump, Rove said, is barely eking out a polling lead in Ohio and Iowa, which Obama won in 2012. But he is also behind in North Carolina and Arizona, states that Romney won. And his deficit in other electoral vote-rich states like Florida is so severe that he is unlikely to pull ahead.
“I doubt that in the just over two weeks we’ve got left, conducting the kind of campaign he’s conducting, that he’s going to be able to swing 1 out of every, you know, 10 voters, 1 out of every 12 voters, 1 out of every 15 voters and 1 out of every 6 voters in a state and convert them,” Rove said.
Rove is not a man who gives up easily. In 2012, he had an on-air meltdown over whether Romney had won or lost Ohio, insisting in vain that the Republican nominee still had a chance to win the election. Romney lost.
Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.

17446c85,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/23/california-man-gets-1500-year-jail-sentence-for-raping-teenage-daughter,"California man gets 1,500-year jail sentence for raping teenage daughter","A Californian man was sentenced to 1,503 years in prison for raping his teenage daughter over a four-year period.
The 41-year-old was sentenced on Friday to the longest-known prison sentence in Fresno superior court history, according to the Fresno Bee reported.
In announcing the punishment, Judge Edward Sarkisian told the man he is a “serious danger to society” and noted that he had never shown remorse and has blamed his daughter for his predicament.
The man’s daughter, who has not been named, was first sexually abused by a family friend but instead of protecting her, he turned her into “a piece of property,” prosecutor Nicole Galstan said.
The victim, now 23, was raped two to three times a week from May 2009 to May 2013, when she got the courage to leave her father, Galstan said.
A jury in September found him guilty of 186 felony counts of sexual assault, including dozens of counts of rape of a minor.
“When my father abused me, I was young. I had no power, no voice. I was defenceless,” she said. She also told the judge that her father never showed remorse for her pain and suffering.
The man turned down two plea deals. Before his preliminary hearing, if he had admitted his guilt, prosecutors would have recommended 13 years in prison. He rejected the offer. Then before his trial, he was offered 22 years in prison if he admitted his guilt. He declined that offer, saying he should be released from jail for the time he already had served, Sarkisian said before announcing the sentence.
“He ruined her teenage years and made her feel like it was her fault,” Galstan said in arguing for the maximum sentence.
The sentencing is in stark contrast to a recent case in Montana, where a man who raped his 12-year-old daughter was not sent to prison. Instead the judge handed down a 30-year suspended sentence after the man pleaded guilty to incest and ordered him to spend 60 days in jail, giving him credit for 17 days already served.

My oldest son, Bryan, started sixth grade at the Red Bank Middle School earlier this month. He's already picked out the shirt he'll wear for college t-shirt day — the red one that says: Harvard. It's his dream.
Sometimes, those big dreams scare my husband and I. We don't have a lot of money or formal education. But we came to America from Mexico 15 years ago for a better life. Still, Harvard? It scares us. We're adults. We put limits on things.
But our son sees no limits. That's because the Red Bank Public Schools made him believe in their motto: Dream Big.
But lately, I've begun to have my doubts. Not about my son's school. But about my community and how a second public school system is dividing my town.
Like most of Red Bank's Latino community, I only began to learn over the past year about the Red Bank Charter School and the segregation it causes. Before that, I was like many Latino parents who had only a vague notion of what the charter school was. Some thought it was a private school. I had been told it wasn't for ""any kid."" 
I took that to mean it WAS NOT for children that were brown or poor.
The state Department of Education statistics show that this is in fact the case. The student body of the Red Bank public schools are 81 percent Latino, while at the charter school only 38 percent are Latino. If you look at the composition of the schools from a socio-economic perspective there is a similar disparity. About 89 percent of the children in the Red Bank public schools qualify for free and reduced lunches, an indicator of poverty, while at the charter school only 41 percent do.
I thought charter schools were supposed to reflect the racial, ethnic and socio-economic composition of the town. In Red Bank this is clearly not the case. The Red Bank Charter School has become a bastion of segregation and privilege.
One of the school trustees, Roger Foss, admitted that the school was created in 1997 to prevent ""white flight."" And last year, when the charter school sought to expand, we discovered that the state of New Jersey had shortchanged our children of more than $6 million in aid over the past six years. Under state law, that's not supposed to happen.
We learned, by reviewing state Department of Education data, that the per-pupil cost of the public schools was $16,607 while the charter was $18,726. Our children are getting less than the state average, while the charter kids are getting more than Rumson, a nearby town far richer than ours.
For years, the charter school said it was doing a better job educating students than the public schools. Now we've learned that's not true either. Last year, the public school eighth graders scored higher on both the verbal and math portions of the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) test, despite the fact most of our kids had to learn English first, which was not true of most charter school students.
The state denied the charter school's expansion request. But the damage to my community has already been done.
Some people no longer talk to their neighbors. There is tension when parents from the schools come together at the kids' sports games. But most hurtful of all are some of the comments I've heard from charter parents. They refer to me and people like me as ""those people.""
We are just people. People like everyone else, who want what's best for our children. People who have woken up to the fact that a small school that only represents a small portion of our town takes far more than its fair share of resources.
Last month, the charter school asked the state Department of Education to renew its charter for five more years. I urge Acting Education Commissioner Kimberly Harrington to deny their request.
Red Bank is a small community. It should have one school system.
The message I would rather hear comes from the Red Bank Public Schools, where they tell kids to Dream Big, because with enough hard work, they have no limits.

825057ba,http://www.voanews.com/a/weakened-isis-may-find-safe-havens-in-rural-iraq-and-syria/3536851.html,"Weakened IS May Find Havens in Rural Iraq, Syria","If expected military offensives rout the Islamic State group from the cities that are its strongholds in Syria and Iraq, military analysts and Kurdish commanders say the extremists would establish bases in rural areas to further their regional terrorism. 
""When they run out of options, and soon they will, [IS fighters] will act more violently outside their areas of control,” said Radwan Badini, a politics professor at Salahaddin University in Irbil, in northern Iraq.
""In the countryside of rural provinces in Syria and Iraq, IS will continue to have an influence and it will try to use these areas as operation centers to stage attacks on their immediate enemies.”
Since 2014, IS has used Iraq and Syria as centers for the establishment and expansion of its self-designated caliphate, virtually changing the map of those two war-torn nations.
Losing territory
However, an array of opposition to Islamic State - including a U.S.-led coalition, government forces, local forces and militia and foreign troops - has left the militant group reeling, and slowly returned parts of Iraq and Syria back to local control.
""We've deprived [IS] of about 25 percent of the territory it once controlled in Syria and more than 50 percent it once controlled in Iraq,”Antony J. Blinken, deputy U.S. secretary of State, said last week during a congressional hearing.
In western Iraq, IS has suffered a series of defeats in Anbar province in recent months.
In the north, Islamic State is fortifying its stronghold in Mosul and planning for a massive attack by Iraqi forces trying to regain control of the city, which had a population of more than two and one-half million when IS captured it more than two years ago. Analysts say the loss of Mosul would leave extremist fighters scattered across a region that is mostly desert.

Mosul loss could doom 'caliphate' 
The ""liberation of Mosul would contain IS expansion in Iraq,"" said Khaled Akkasheh, head of the National Center for Security Studies in Cairo, and ensure the gradual demise of “their so-called caliphate.""
Others say IS would still be a menacing force in Iraq even after losing control of Mosul. 
Islamic State is supported by some of the Sunni tribes in Anbar province, according to Aras Dizayee, a military strategist in Irbil. ""The group will be relevant as long as it has popular support in these areas,” he said.
Sunni tribes feel alienated from the Shi'ite-dominated Iraqi government in Baghdad, and some see IS as an alternative power base. And some Sunni tribes have profited from doing business with Islamic State - smuggling in oil and goods from IS-controlled territory.
""IS would continue collaborating with these Sunni tribes because that gives it legitimacy among people and a sort of military alliance,” Dizayee said.
Turning old tactic
The Irbil-based analyst said it will be difficult to eliminate IS influence, because the extremist group's members and sympathizers are dispersed among the general population, and from there they can employ an old tactic.
""They know a moment will come where they no longer control territory,” Dizayee said. “So they have trained many suicide bombers, mainly children, to carry out attacks.”
Islamic State's influence in Suinni areas of Iraq likely will spread into Syria, Kurdish commanders say.
“IS has many strong pockets along the Iraq-Syria border,” said General Sime Usali, a commander of Kurdish Peshmerga forces near Mosul. ""They will likely be concentrated in those areas when they have been pushed out of Mosul.”
It remains to be seen who will lead IS in Iraq and Syria in the future.
The U.S. military has been targeting IS leadership for months, killing IS commanders in September, 13 of them in the Mosul area. Many more IS leaders are likely to lose their lives in the Mosul battle, analysts say.
""Most of the top-tier IS leaders who have been targeted by U.S. strikes possessed skills that their successors don't necessarily have,"" said analyst Akkasheh. ""But that doesn't mean that [IS] can entirely be weakened.”

The spillover effect from an IS retreat from Mosul will likely coincide with a depleted IS in Syria.
The U.S.-led coalition, Turkey and Arab forces are planning an assault in the group's Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, after pushing IS out of northern Syria in recent weeks.
Routing IS from Raqqa could further complicate the chaotic situation in the Syrian civil war, analysts say. IS is increasing its presence in areas once held by Syrian rebel forces, and is battling both Damascus government forces and rebels in central and southern Syria.
""Symbolically, removing [IS] from its self-proclaimed capital is significant,” Akkasheh said in an interview with VOA. ""Strategically, however, it would perhaps allow IS to search for newer footings.”

1f649229,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-donald-trump-problem_us_58091ac1e4b02444efa260fa,Paul Ryan’s Donald Trump Problem Isn’t Going Anywhere,"WASHINGTON ― Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has finally settled on a strategy for dealing with Donald Trump: Ignore the GOP nominee and just hope he goes away after an embarrassing defeat on Nov. 8.
The problem for Ryan is that Trump, his supporters and his policies do not seem to be going anywhere, even if he loses spectacularly.
Ryan’s favorability has fallen 28 points over the past two weeks, fueled by Trump turning his attention to the speaker and criticizing him for sowing division in the party, seemingly without any sense of irony.
A Bloomberg poll conducted Oct. 14-17 showed that 51 percent of Republicans think the Trump’s view of what the GOP stands for better matches theirs, compared to 33 percent who said Ryan’s perspective more closely matched theirs.
Ryan has set himself up for a confrontation with Trump after Election Day. “Come Nov. 9, there will be a fight for who we are, what we stand for,” one top GOP aide told The Huffington Post this month.
But, if there is a fight for the Republican Party, there is no evidence to suggest Republicans will side with Ryan. And there’s no indication of Trump is going anywhere.
Following the final debate, in which Trump raised the specter of continuing his fight even after losing, one senior GOP leadership aide told HuffPost on Thursday that Ryan’s sudden drop in favorability probably wouldn’t be a lasting dip. “It shouldn’t shock anyone that his numbers took a hit immediately after Trump went on a tirade, especially when the speaker’s been quiet, keeping his head down stumping for our guys,” the aide said.
A fair point, but Ryan’s fall from grace may be much larger than a single poll.
One thing you can say about Trump is that he’s demonstrated Republican leaders were probably a bit ahead of the GOP base on issues like trade, immigration, even entitlement reform. Ryan has publicly taken positions contrary to Trump on these very issues.
A September poll showed 85 percent of Republicans agreeing with Trump’s belief that free trade has cost more jobs than it’s created. And an April poll found 63 percent of Republicans support building a wall between the entirety of the U.S.-Mexico border, in line with Trump’s pledge.
Ryan is on the other side of those issues and will have to square his positions with those of his party at some point, and it’s unclear how he does that when Republicans are so divided.
On top of the ideological issues, Ryan has some practical problems following the election. If you believe Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the House GOP is going to be in single digits “either way” ― meaning Ryan will have lost more than 20 seats and, potentially, the Republican majority.
ASSOCIATED PRESS
Of course, things might not be that bad for Republicans. They could walk away from the year of Trump losing only a dozen or so House seats. But almost no one expects Republicans to gain seats, or really even keep their losses in the single digits.
If Democratic gains are closer to Pelosi’s projection, it will present Ryan with considerable vote problems on his reelection to be speaker, let alone every piece of legislation that comes before the House. Suddenly, Ryan would have to turn to Democrats for votes to pass legislation, which could further damage his standing with Republicans.
“If we lose 15, it’ll be tough for Paul Ryan,” one GOP member told HuffPost this month. That means, as other members have told HuffPost, Ryan already has a speaker reelection problem. And that’s before Trump starts whipping up the GOP base. Already, we see some conservatives in the House looking apt to use Ryan’s less-than-enthusiastic support of Trump as a way to potentially remove him.
“If Paul Ryan isn’t for Trump, then I’m not for Paul Ryan,” Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.) said in a Twitter post last week.
Ryan also has to navigate a December spending deal that’s likely to anger many other Republicans and test the promises of regular order that he made last year when he took the speakership.
And these are just the known variables. If Trump truly does contest that the election was rigged by virtue of the fact that he lost, Ryan’s first confrontation may be tamping down that revolt.
So the speaker’s problems with Trump aren’t going anywhere. By committing to Trump, Ryan and the Republican Party more broadly has solidified its reputation as an anti-immigrant party ― a reputation the GOP desperately looked to shake after the 2012 election, recognizing that winning over immigrants was necessary to winning national elections. And Ryan has imperiled his own reputation as a serious-minded policy wonk by continuing to support Trump through every outrage.
Ryan may be able to reintroduce some distance between himself and Trump after the election (no one really believes he’s on board with the nominee), but some voters will ― and should ― always remember that the speaker didn’t speak out when it really mattered.
On the other side, Ryan has clearly angered Trump voters, some of whom might never return to the Republican Party.
The grand joke of Trump’s candidacy is that prominent GOP members didn’t speak out against the party’s nominee in the beginning, nor bar him from running as a Republican, because they feared he would run as an independent and split the party. Now, after tarnishing the Grand Old Party as an association that accepts misogyny and racism, Trump may split the GOP anyway.
And Ryan ignoring Trump will seem even more impossible.
Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S.

Cheyenne, Wyo. - A Utah man sentenced to at least 30 years up to life in a basement-kidnap case is now set to face murder charges in Wyoming.
Dereck James ""DJ"" Harrison is expected to be extradited shortly after his sentencing Monday in Utah. Upon his return to Wyoming, he could face the death penalty for the murder of a train worker.
Police say the 23-year-old and his father, Flint Harrison, killed a train worker in Wyoming while on the run from police after restraining and beating a woman and her four daughters. The woman and her daughters escaped.
Police say the suspects hid in the Salt Lake City area before kidnapping the 63-year-old man and beating him to death. They were arrested in Wyoming after a manhunt.
Flint Harrison killed himself in jail.

TMZ reports this morning that Brad Pitt does not plan to answer Angelina Jolie’s divorce petition, because he does not want to “set the stage for a nasty legal battle.” The deadline for him to respond was Wednesday. According to TMZ, Pitt and Jolie still disagree about custody of their six children: Jolie wants sole physical custody, and Pitt wants joint custody. Pitt’s inaction shows, however, that the estranged couple may be ready to settle matters privately.
Here’s the complicating factor: The Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services is still investigating Pitt’s plane incident that reportedly triggered Jolie to file for divorce. Pitt and Jolie agreed to a temporary custody plan set out by the DCFS, but that deal expired yesterday. DCFS could now make further recommendations or potentially close the case. If the department closes the case, Pitt could decide to respond to Jolie’s divorce petition, because as TMZ notes, he would be coming from a stronger negotiating position. People, which has largely served as Pitt’s PR vehicle since Jolie filed for divorce, reported earlier this week that “no real progress will be made until both parties receive feedback from the DFCS investigation.”
There is another sign that the estranged couple may be ready to settle the custody disagreement, however. According to TMZ, Pitt met with son Maddox, who was reportedly involved in the plane incident, for the first time on Wednesday.
“Sources connected with Angelina tell us the two met Wednesday afternoon with a therapist present,” TMZ reported yesterday. “There had been a plan in place for Brad and Maddox to reunite a while back, but we’re told the therapist felt the timing wasn’t right.The sources say Brad has had visits with his five other kids before Wednesday, but the face-to-face with Maddox is a turning point.”

The event is sponsored by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
In Iowa, there were more than 100 sites that teamed up to collect old or unused medications.
In Scott County, Take Back Day was held at the Waste Commission. There, Scott County Sheriff’s Officers assisted in the collection of prescription medication people dropped off.
“We tell people not to store up or save those items in their homes because kids can get to them, other people can break in,” said Detective with the Scott County Sheriff’s Office, Rachelle Kunde.
She also said, prescriptions are easier for some to get their hands on.
“There is a large rise of prescription drugs, over use or misuse coming on to society now,” said Detective Kunde. “I just think that some other drugs are harder to get and prescription drugs are alot easier, especially for youth, to get their hands on.”
Some people don’t realize they can dispose of most of their unused prescriptions on their own.
“Years ago we used tell people do not throw them in the garbage, do not put them down the sinks, anything like that,” said Detective Kunde.
But now people can throw away their prescriptions at home, and Scott County Sheriff Officer’s worked to educate those that dropped meds off at the Waste Commission.
“We prefer people to take those drugs that they have and go ahead and put them with their undesirable garbage and it will go to the landfill,” said Detective Kunde.
But, Detective Kunde says she thinks some people are nervous about putting their pill bottles in the trash.
“I think people are concerned about throwing their pills in the garbage because their names on the prescription bottles and, if that’s the case, we encourage people to separate pills from the containers, remove labels if you would like to do that,” said Detective Kunde.
Scott County Sheriff’s Office encourages people to put their prescriptions in a sealed container or even make them “undesirable” by mixing them with material like old coffee grounds.

They named the icy giant – which takes 20,000 Earth years to orbit the Sun – “Planet 9”.
As evidence of the new planet mounts, scientists now expect to finally see it down by winter 2017.
And they have warned it is ABSOLUTELY ENORMOUS.
ICEMAN COMETH: An artist's impression of Planet 9
 “By the end of next winter somebody's going to track this down” 
 Mike Brown 
Planet 9 is so gigantic its gravitational field is actually causing the Sun itself and the entire Solar System to tilt on a six-degree angle, astronomers now believe.
They noticed some objects in the Kuiper Belt – a band of asteroids, comets, ice balls and space rocks at the edge of our Solar System – had weird orbits.
This would only make sense of there was another “Super Earth” out past Pluto.
Planet Osiris is around 30% bigger than jupiter and is around 1,832 degrees in Fahrenheit
But Caltech now believe Planet 9’s power goes right to the heart of the Solar System.
Elizabeth Bailey, of Caltech, said: “Because Planet 9 is so massive and has an orbit tilted compared to the other planets the Solar System has no choice but to slowly twist out of alignment.”
Her boss Mike Brown – who first revealed evidence of the lurking giant in January – said: “At this stage we have so many lines of evidence that there’s a massive planet out there that if there’s not a massive planet out there it has to be that there was one there yesterday and disappeared.”
Maverick scientists have speculated about the existence of another planet – until now dubbed ""Planet X"" – since the 19th century.
But the theory fell out of favour and most respected astronomers insisted Neptune was the furthest planet orbiting our Sun – with only dwarf planet Pluto beyond.
Amateur star gazers were dismissed as cranks – or worse – for continuing the search for Planet X.
So when writer Zecharia Sitchin claimed to have to have found a description of a giant planet called Nibiru among the writings of the Babylonians – an ancient civilisation famed as pioneers of astronomy – he was ridiculed as a crackpot.
He claimed the orbit of Nibiru – which was home to advanced alien race called the Annunaki – brought it near Earth every 3,600 years.
END OF TIMES: Believers think Nibiru will wipe out life on Earth
Can you spot these extraterrestrial objects?
Nibiru “truthers” have prophesied a collision or near-miss will destroy the Earth in a myth dubbed the ""Nibiru Cataclysm”.
This has also been dismissed as rubbish.
Daniel Whitmire, of the University of Louisiana, claims as Planet 9 passes through the Kuiper Belt it knocks asteroids out of their orbit and fires them towards Earth.
He said this has caused apocalyptic ""extinction events"" found to have taken place on Earth every 27million years.
William Shatner: is a UFO believer, saying, 'There is no doubt that there is life out there; the mathematics of it lead you to that absolute conclusion. In my mind, there is no doubt that the universe teems - with life in all its form'
Mr Brown said there are now so many telescopes scouring the night sky for Planet 9 it will soon be spotted.
He said: ""I'm pretty sure that by the end of next winter – not this winter, next winter – I think that there'll be enough people looking for it that somebody's actually going to track this down.
“By the next meeting, we'll be talking about finding Planet 9 instead of just looking for it.”

Donald Trump crushed Hillary Clinton in the second debate. Can’t really be argued.
However, debates 1 and 3 could’ve gone either way – if we’re being honest with ourselves.
Maybe there was a reason for it.
Debate 2 was a town hall which featured the candidates standing to answer questions without a podium in front of them.
Debates 1 and 3 had podiums.
Remember when social media was going crazy wondering about Hillary’s odd head movements during debate 2?
Follow me all the way down the post – because this gets really good!

After the first debate, numerous videos surfaced alleging that Hillary was using some sort of teleprompter built into her podium to assist with answering questions or to offset whatever medical condition she’s dealing with. The videos were largely dismissed as “cooky alt-right conspiracy theories” and didn’t get much attention outside of those spheres. 
But, when similar abnormalities surfaced on Hillary’s podium in the third debate, combined with the fact that she spent an awkward amount of time during her answers peering down rather than at the camera, we grew a bit more curious.
With that said, here is a video analyzing the abnormalities from debate 1. Notice that around 18 seconds into this video one can very clearly see a light shut off on Hillary’s podium even though there is no such light at Trump’s podium.
You can see the same exact thing happen here at the 1:38:30 mark…
In this picture you can see a light on Hillary’s podium at debate 1, but not Trump’s…

When Mercy got pregnant, she had to return home to give birth, as she was in Texas with a temporary visa from El Salvador. Rich stayed in the U.S. and awaited his wife’s return. However, as soon as the nurse handed Mercy her newborn son Jacob, she knew something was terribly wrong. 
“When I got him, I said, ‘This is not my baby,’” Mercy told WFAA. 
Something in her gut, call it maternal instinct, told her this was not her child. But how was she to really argue? 
With that, they took the little guy home. 
Still, it was an itch she couldn’t scratch. After a couple of months, Mercy had a DNA test done. Jacob was not their son. She had always known it, but it wasn’t easy to accept. Biological or not, Mercy and Rich formed a strong bond with him. The only question left: where was their biological son? 
After reaching out to the proper officials, Mercy and Rich returned Jacob to his biological family. However, the El Salvadorian government was not welcoming to their biological son Moses.They refused to give him a birth certificate or passport to travel to the United States for an entire year. 
After a long battle with the government, Rich and Mercy have come back home with their baby boy.

Fresh problems for “Obamacare.” The largest health insurer in Texas wants to raise its rates on individual policies an average of nearly 60 percent, a sign that President Barack Obama’s overhaul didn’t solve the problem of price spikes. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) Photo by The Associated Press /Times Free Press.
Despite record increases in premium rates by major health insurers, 81 percent of Tennesseans should be able to buy individual health insurance coverage under the health exchanges of the Affordable Care Act for $75 per month or less, according to government figures released today.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said Tennessee consumers will have an average of seven plans to choose from for their health care coverage in 2017 through the health insurance exchanges. HHS estimates 83 percent of those plans will cost the consumer $100 or less once government subsidies for low- and moderate-income families are provided to those signing up for such plans.
""Thanks to financial assistance, the large majority of current Marketplace consumers in Tennessee will be able to find plans with premiums between $50 and $100 per month,"" Health and Human Services Director Sylvia M. Burwell said in a statement today. ""Many uninsured Tennesseans could also qualify for financial assistance, as could 79,000 Tennesseans currently paying full price for off-Marketplace coverage.""
The Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, provides financial subsidies for most of the so-called working poor or middle-income families with children who don't qualify for Medicaid or don't have employer-sponsored health plans where they work.
Health insurance premiums for individual plans next year are going up by an average of 62 percent for plans offered by BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, the state's biggest provider of ACA plans. Cigna Healthcare is raising its individual premiums by 46.3 percent and Humana individual rates are going up by 44.3 percent in 2017, according to rate increases approved this summer by the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance.
But most of those increases will be paid by the government, which is subsidizing coverage for many low- and moderate-income families who don't participate in group plans at work. Tax credits increase dollar for dollar with the cost of a consumer's benchmark plan so most of the premium increases for low- and moderate-income families buying individual plans will be absorbed by the federal government.
For example, a 27-year-old in Chattanooga with an income of $25,000 would qualify for $351 per month in premium tax credits to help buy the most popular health insurance coverage next year. That should offset most of the costs of such coverage and keep premiums up only a few dollars from last year.
Open enrollment for persons to sign up for coverage in 2017 starts next Tuesday, Nov. 1 and plan information is now available at www.healthcare.gov.
HHS said the share of Tennesseans without health insurance now stands at 10.3 percent, down 28 percent since 2010 when Congress adopted ObamaCare.
""This year's Open Enrollment offers the chance to build on that progress and further improve access to care and financial security for Tennesseans,"" Burwell said.
HHS also urged those returning to the ObamaCare program and re-enrolling during the open enrollment period to shop around for the best plan. If every returning consumer in Tennessee selected the lowest-cost plan available within their current metal level, average premiums would decrease by $37 per month, or 28 percent, from 2016 to 2017, HHS said.
But the number of plans available will be down for 2017 after United Healthcare withdrew from the market, Community Health Alliance of Knoxville was forced to shut down, and BlueCross scaled back its participation in the Obamacare program and ended its coverage in the state's three biggest cities.
""This is more evidence that Obamacare is falling apart,"" U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said this summer after BlueCross announced its decision to limit its participation, raise rates and not offer its individual health plans in all 95 counties. ""Short term, we need to give families the opportunity to use their Obamacare subsidies to buy a policy for 2017 outside of the exchange. Longer term, regardless of who the new president is, we need to replace Obamacare with insurance choices that allow Tennesseans to select low-cost insurance that fits their budget and their health care needs.""
But HHS said in spite of higher premiums and more limited coverage options for Tennessee consumers in 2017, ObamaCare is still working. Through 2016, rates for individual health insurance plans in the exchange marketplace remained below initial projections from the independent Congressional Budget Office, and below the cost of comparable coverage in the employer market.
""Even though average Marketplace premiums are increasing more than they have the past two years, premiums in 2017 will remain roughly in line with projections issued by the Congressional Budget Office during the debate over the Affordable Care Act (ACA),"" Burwell said. ""Tennessee has made historic progress under the ACA, and now we want to build on that progress to further improve affordability, access, and quality.""
But the Chattanooga-based BlueCross plan for Tennessee estimates it has lost nearly $500 million over the first three years of its participation in the ObamaCare program on its individual health exchange plans, which were initially priced among the lowest in the country.
Some of the ACA's programs designed to support the new market in its early years are ending this year. Tennessee also opted not to expand the Medicaid program, which designers of ObamaCare envisioned as a means to help ensure that more persons were covered by health plans so hospitals and physicians wouldn't have to continue to shift the burden of uncompensated care on those with insurance.
Last year even after the average rate on individual health plans jumped by 23 percent in Tennessee, the average premium for the 85 percent of Tennessee consumers with tax credits went up by only $2, or 2 percent, HHS said.
""Before the ACA, up to 2.8 million Tennesseans with pre-existing conditions were at risk of having no coverage options at all, and the individual market offered no easy way to shop and compare plans,"" said Kevin Counihan, CEO of the Health Insurance Marketplace. ""Now, consumers can shop around to find coverage that fits their needs and get tax credits to help pay for it. Thanks to shopping and financial assistance, consumers will continue to have robust options for quality, affordable coverage.""
HHS said its new Plan Compare 2.0 will offer a simpler, step-by-step sign-up process that integrates improved physician and drug look-up tools directly into the shopping experience to help improve how consumes buy their plans.

3843c9e7,https://medium.com/@DBCopa/the-skewed-polls-of-2016-e57c9274b4f8#.ru2syvc0k,The Skewed Polls of 2016,"With 15 days to go before November 8th, we have most polls showing Hillary with a fairly comfortable lead. However, it is undeniable that the energy for Trump shown in his supporters dwarfs whatever desire there is to vote for Hillary. In 2012 there were many calls saying that the polls then were skewed. That was not the case. However, a very strong case can be made that they are this year.
Polls are always based on what has happened in the past with certain allowances for what might be happening currently. Also, polls are weighted differently by the different organizations based on their particular prejudices.
Some additional points to consider:
- Wikileaks and the FBI document dumps have shown tremendous corruption, collusion and rigging by the Democrat party, the Clinton campaign, governmental organizations and the media.
- The polls most recognizable to everyone are tied to media organizations even if they’re not sponsored by them (e.g. ABC News/Washington Post Poll). Even polls like Monmouth are dependent on the media to spread their results. Therefore, to have results that are appreciated by the press at large (which is in collusion with the Democrats) is good for business.
- The media ceased being journalism decades ago. Now the media simply cares about advancing a narrative despite the facts. The Benghazi video, the characterization of the Tea Party vs.Occupy Wall Street and Hillary/Bill women scandals vs. Trump’s are all good examples of this.
- Polls have been shown to be a good way to shape public opinion. With anyone who is not Politically Correct ostracized from society, people can be swayed (for a while at least) towards a certain way of thinking if it is perceived that a majority of other people feel a certain way about things.
In 2008 and 2012 Barack Obama ran and had tremendous support from Blacks, Hispanics and younger voters — support far above historical norms in regard to the percentages and numbers within those demographic groups voting in the past. It can be argued very strongly that this support for Obama was for Obama the person rather than for his ideas or policies. The Democrat’s overwhelming defeats in the mid term elections of 2010 and 2014, when his name was not on the ballot but his policies were, prove this.
Remember that polls are based largely on past results. Since each poll’s specific methodology and particular internal weighting percentages are not published (kind of like a chef’s secret ingredients in his sauce) we cannot “fact check” the polls and have to rely on them to be “fair”. Even though we can’t see the specific weighting within each poll, we can see the sample size for Republicans, Democrats and Independents.
Since we are in 2016, Barack Obama is not running. Hillary Clinton has nowhere near the personal draw that Obama had. Yet, the polls don’t take that into account. They still sample Democrats as high as if this were 2008 or 2012. The chance that Blacks, Hispanics and young people will come out in the overwhelming numbers for Hillary like they did for Obama is extremely small. It’s not that Hillary won’t win these groups by a large percentage amount — it’s that the total vote numbers will not be nearly as large as they were with Obama. In other words there will be fewer Black voters for Hillary even if she wins the usual 90–95% of the Black vote that every Democrat has received since 1964 (a big if).
That’s where the Wikileaks and FBI document dumps come into play. With the tremendous collusion and corruption that has been shown over and over and over again between the Clinton campaign, the media and the Democrat party the validity of the poll results shrinks considerably. Knowing that Hillary will not draw the huge numbers that Obama drew, it is easy to see that these organizations, and the polling companies that are beholden to them for publicity will, push a narrative of the inevitability of Hillary with polling data to back that up. The latest Podesta email dump today (Oct 23) confirms this.
So if the polls are skewed this year, as I believe they are, is it by an amount large enough for Trump to win? That is hard to say exactly for obvious reasons but I think the skewing is off enough for this to be a neck and neck race with polling the people as if this were a normal election with a normal electorate.
However, this is anything but a “normal election” and the huge wild card is that we do not have a “normal electorate”. Trump has energized people who have not voted for years. He won the Republican nomination with more votes than any previous candidate in a 16 person field by getting a ton of non-traditional Republican primary voters. That was a result that no one predicted.
The Democrats saw their primary vote numbers drastically fall compared to 2008 or even 2004. Even though the Democrat primaries in 2016 were contested longer than the Republican primaries were there was far less enthusiasm overall. Good thing that Hillary and the Democrat National Committee had the whole process rigged against Bernie Sanders.
It will be these non-traditional voters who haven’t voted in years (or decades) and the lack of enthusiasm for Hillary among Blacks, Hispanic and young voters that will ultimately push this election to Trump despite what the polls say. When you throw the consistent polling result for the past 2–3 years that over 70% of America think the country is on the wrong track and want change, then I am even more confident of a Trump victory.
That is, of course, if the entire election is not rigged like the Democrat primary was.

In a release, the Log Cabin Republicans called Trump “perhaps the most pro-LGBT presidential nominee in the history of the Republican Party.”
However, they chose not to endorse Trump because of the “senior advisers” surrounding the candidate. That includes his running mate, Mike Pence, who passed anti-LGBT legislation when he was governor of Indiana, and former opponent Ted Cruz, who will serve on Trump’s religious advisory council.

8b70ec96,http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/10/amber-rose-biggest-boobs-weve-ever-seen/,Amber Rose: Biggest Boobs We've Ever SEEN!," Amber Rose, bustier than ever, shared a pic on Instagram that's got everybody talking. 
 Check out the pic and you'll see what we mean - each boob is at least 30% larger than her actual head. 
 If that doesn't say something about the state of Amber Rose's boobs, then your tongue fell out somewhere along the way. 
 Damn, right? Amber's always been pretty buxom, but she either lost weight everywhere - including in her head, and except for her chest ...
 Or we've never actually seen the finer nuances of Amber's gigantor, city-crushing breasts before. 
 Rose previously reported that her breasts were a 36H. 
 She once considered getting implants, but was undecided, and never revealed her decision - publicly. 
 ""I don't know if I want to get an implant because my boobs are kind of really nice,"" she told Dr. Terry Dubrow of Botched. 
 Her boobs previously appeared to be smaller, so we don't know if she's pulling what the Kardashians allegedly pull - sucking the fat out of one area of their bodies in order to put it into another area - but one thing is certain: we are afraid of those things. 
 There is, in this case, a point where the boobs get too big or the body gets too small, and Amber Rose is teetering right on the brink of that edge. 
 If we're lucky, the weight of those things will pull her down to one side or the other, and we'll really find out what she's made of - both literally and figuratively. 
 The only other time she was this busty was when Amber was pregnant with her son, Sebastian. 
 Those things were large and in charge, then, too, but we have a sneaking suspicion that Rose isn't pregnant this time around. 
 ...Unless you count being pregnant with silicone a thing. 
 Did Amber Rose go under the knife and get her boobs done? Did she just lose weight? Or is it just a really flattering (or unflattering, depending on your perspective) pose? 
 Only one thing is certain - any man who wants to mess with that better be wearing some kind of serious headgear to prevent spinal injury.

The blonde beauty announced her return to the airwaves in May, almost one year to the day since she had her final, emotional farewell at Radio 1 after 10 years.
Fearne made her Radio 2 debut alongside Spandeau Ballet's Martin Kemp in July as they filled in for Graham Norton over the summer.
The star raises two children, son Rex, three, and daughter Honey, 13 months, with musician husband Jesse Wood, the son of Rolling Stones legend Ronnie Wood.
And she recently admitted her attitude to work has changed since welcoming her second child into the world.

Speaking to HELLO! magazine, Fearne said: 'As I've gotten older what I want out of life has changed massively, and it's less about achieving things and goals and more about general wellbeing and happiness.
'If I'm feeling a bit rubbish, it can be instantly switched up by hanging with my kids, my husband or good friends.
'As I've got older I've realised it really is simple things like that, or yoga or swimming or baking – whatever little hobby or ritual you need to kind of click yourself back in.'

682a78cd,http://blacksportsonline.com/home/2016/10/how-future-broke-up-scottie-pippens-marriage/,How Future Broke Up Scottie Pippen’s Marriage,"Earlier this week it was reported by TMZ Sports that Scottie Pippen filed for divorce from Larsa Pippen. Rumors are swirling that Larsa and Future are fooling around because they’ve been spotted together in Miami several times.
Larsa denied that she was seeing Future and Future said that he has plenty of other women so why go after a married one.
However, TMZ Sports reports that Larsa and Future met back in August at Haute Living Color Reveal Party and a “source” from Larsa’s side is claiming that her status with Future is casual.
Scottie and Larsa Pippen agreed on a divorce weeks ago but held it off and then Future is what broke the camels back for Scottie.
TMZ Sports also reported that cops have been to their house twice this month due to heated arguments.
It’s clear that their issues go past Future but Scottie may have felt this was the out.
Future is always involved in something messy.

An international team of scientists from the Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) are investigating mysterious signal spikes emitting from a 65 billion year-old star in the constellation Hercules–95 light years away from Earth. The implications are extraordinary and point to the possibility of a civilization far more advanced than our own.

The unusual signal was originally detected on May 15, 2015 by the Russian Academy of Science-operated RATAN-600 radio telescope in Zelenchukskaya, Russia but was kept secret from the international community. Interstellar space reporter  Paul Gilster broke the story after the researchers quietly circulated a paper announcing the detection of “a strong signal in the direction of HD164595.”

The mysterious star’s designation is HD164595 and it’s considered to be sun-like in nature with a nearly identical metallic composition to our own star. So far, a single Neptune-like (but warmer) planet has been discovered in its orbit–HD 164595 b. But as Gilster explained, “there could, of course, be other planets still undetected in this system.”

Decorated Italian SETI researcher and mathematician Claudio Maccone along with Russia’s Nikolai Bursov of the Special Astrophysical Observatory are the principal scientists working on the apparent discovery. They claim that “permanent monitoring of this target is needed.”

“The signal conceivably fits the profile for an intentional transmission from an extraterrestrial source,” says Alan Boyle, author of “The Case for Pluto” who reported the story for Geekwire. “ In any case, the blip is interesting enough to merit discussion by those who specialize in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI.”

In his acclaimed work “Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations,” Soviet Astronomer Nikolai Kardashev explained that a Type II civilization would be able to harness the energy of their entire host star. The most common hypothetical example of this would be a Dyson Sphere–which is a massive artificial structure that could completely encapsulate a star and transfer the energy to a nearby planet.

Basically, if the signal was beamed out into the galaxy without aim or direction, that would require an enormous amount of power to actually be detected. But what if the signal was beamed specifically at our solar system? Well, that would require less energy and could indicate the presence of a Kardashev Type I civilization–meaning that it could be a highly-technological, contemporary society that harnesses the solar energy emitted by its local star, much like our planet does with solar panels. This particular civilization’s social structure is theorized to be completely globalized and interconnected.

“The signal is provocative enough that the RATAN-600 researchers are calling for permanent monitoring of this target,” said Gilster. And that’s exactly what is transpiring. As of last night, the SETI institute is diverting its Allen Telescope Array in northern California to investigate while their counterparts at METI International (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence) will utilize Panama’s Boquete Optical Observatory.

The detection of the mysterious signal and the ensuing investigations will be discussed at the IAA SETI Permanent Committee during the 67th International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, on September 27th–the same day and location where Elon Musk will reveal his plans to colonize Mars . The Observer will be following up on both these stories from the Congress.

Since it first took over the world, 50 Shades of Grey has become far more than merely three books and their movie counterparts. To quote LL, it's something of a phenomenon. Which means, naturally, that it's also inspired multiple lingerie lines and some adventurous sex toy collections. The latest of the latter, from sex toy company Lovehoney, is based on the upcoming film sequel, 50 Shades Darker.
Because things get a whole lot, um, darker, this time around, Lovehoney went with a chic, all-black set of toys. In contrast to the company's original 50 Shades collection—which offers tamer products like lube and vibrators, along with kinkier ones—the set based on the sequel is almost exclusively devoted to bondage. It includes nipple clamps, handcuffs, a paddle, and something called a ""clitoral clamp,"" which does exactly what it says on the label. Some offerings are pretty pricey: you can get a collar with a chain and a spreader bar (which, again, does exactly what it sounds like it does) for $164.99 each.
""We've worked closely with E. L. James and used materials like stainless steel, premium silicone, and glass to make this collection one of our best yet,"" reads Lovehoney's site, which describes the 15 products as ""bondage and toys designed specifically around the second book and new film."" For some inspiration, check out the trailer below:
Lovehoney's 50 Shades toys also come in a Pleasure Collection, Sensual Care Collection, Playroom Collection, and Weekend Collection. Combined, the collections run the gamut, and include kegel balls, butt plugs, cock rings, and (of course) whips. ""Whether you want to take your first steps with a bedroom bondage kit or go the whole hog and recreate scenes from Fifty Shades of Grey, our bondage guides are here to help,"" it reads below each product.
Just remember to check out our tips for how to (safely) wade into the BDSM pool here.

Shocking video 'shows bouncer kicking mouthy young man' as he lies in the street outside nightclub,"Bouncers were caught on camera as they beat up a 'mouthy' shirtless party-goer outside a nightclub.
The doormen allegedly chased down the reveller and his friend after they started shouting and swearing outside a night spot in Rochester, Kent, on Saturday night.
Some of the bouncers were seen punching and kicking the man as others stood watching. One can be heard saying: 'I will knock you into next week you ****'.
The shocking scene was filmed by Sam Beck, 32, from Chatham, Kent.
Mr Beck said: 'The two boys were being mouthy but the bouncers were over the top. You could hear the guy screaming as they beat him up and kicked him.'
Mr Beck said he saw the shirtless revellers shouting at bouncers at around 11.30pm. The men are understood to have travelled to the area for a football match.
One was bleeding from the mouth and smashed a glass bottle on the pavement in frustration, Mr Beck said.
He said: 'A bouncer said to one boy, 'I've given you a hiding already and I can give you another one if you like?'

The shocking scene was filmed by another clubber, who said the shirtless men were 'mouthy'
'Two of the bouncers looked at each other and said they were going to get them and then four others joined in.
'They started punching them both to the ground but they beat up one kid really badly.
'They were kicking him on the ground and when I spoke to the guy after he said his ribs were in a lot of pain.'

The bouncers were eventually pulled off the men by passers-by. Police sirens can be heard in the video but the incident was not officially reported.
A spokesman for Kent Police said: 'Kent Police is aware of a video circulating on social media regarding an incident in Rochester High Street, believed to have taken place on October 22.
'The incident has not been reported to police but officers are reviewing the footage and will conduct initial enquires.'
